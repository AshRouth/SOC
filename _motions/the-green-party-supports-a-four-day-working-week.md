## Synopsis

This motion clarifies and improves our policies in Policies for a Sustainable Society on shortening the working week, and explains the basis for our claim that we support a four day week.

## Motion

In Policies for a Sustainable Society, in the workers’ rights policy section, amend the following articles:

~~WR344 We are committed in the medium-term to a reduction in working hours to an average of 35 hours per week. The Green Party will enact legislation in order to bring about this change.~~

~~WR345 The Party will review the progress and implications of the legislation introduced in France for a 35-hour week (the so-called Aubrey law) in order to formulate the most effective legislation for the UK.~~

~~WR346 We will act to protect the earnings of the hourly paid under the legislation for a 35-hour week. The integration of this reduction in working hours with the proposed Citizens Income will be reviewed.~~

~~WR347 When calculating the average working week there are different reference time periods that may be used. A reference time period may be over a week, a month, a quarter or a year. The Party remains agnostic over the exact choice of reference period for calculating working hours. However, it notes that a reference period of a year will provide the flexibility often required by smaller, seasonally-based businesses.~~

~~WR348 There will be incentives for employers who provide support facilities at the workplace such as childcare, job-sharing, flexible working, counselling and family planning~~


To read as follows (new wording in bold):

WR344 **Under the Green Party, the full time working week will be reduced to 35 hours in the short term and 32 in the medium term. In the medium term, workers will have a right to request these reduced hours at no loss of pay and without detriment. The Green Party will develop pilot schemes, monitoring and effective support, for small to medium sized businesses and public sector institutions, during the process of transition to a shorter worker week.**

WR345 **We would learn from existing schemes to progressively reduce working hours, to determine the most effective way to implement the reduction in the UK.**

WR346 **Pay for both full time workers, part time workers, and the minimum wage will be protected during the transition to a shorter working week, to ensure that there is no reduction in household income. The process will, as appropriate, be integrated with our introduction of a universal basic income (WR361, EC730-734) in the medium term, and with reforms to the benefits system, to end the need for in-work benefits subsidising a low wage economy**.

WR347 When calculating the average working week there are different reference time periods that may be used. A reference time period may be over a week, a month, a quarter or a year. The Party remains agnostic over the exact choice of reference period for calculating working hours. However, it notes that a reference period of a year will provide the flexibility often required by smaller, seasonally-based businesses.

**WR348 The recommended reduction in the working week, and other legislation relating to worker support, will be implemented following detailed consultation with trades unions, small business organisations, major industries, and public sector institutions across a range of industries and services, to ensure that the legislation is supportive and inclusive for everyone.**

**WR349 All employers will be expected to agree flexible working arrangements for those with family and caring commitments, and/or to permit the workers to fulfil their hours over a four day week, unless the work is such that distributing duties in such ways is clearly impossible or harmful. Decisions concerning exemptions must be agreed with the relevant trade union.**

WR**350** **Workplaces will be expected to provide onsite childcare where possible, or, if no onsite childcare is available, they must support workers with accessing suitable childcare facilities off site. In addition other kinds of worker support must be offered including access to counselling, job-sharing, family planning as necessary.**

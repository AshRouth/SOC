Synopsis


Healthcare-Associated Infections (HCAIs) are prevalent and very expensive in terms of healthcare resources and peoples’ lives. On average, 22-25% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients acquire infection during their stay in ICU. Direct cost of infections in Europe was about €7bn in 2012.


Copper (and its alloys) are really effective [Note from SOC - Synopsis word limit reached]


Motion


That the Green Party endorses the use of antimicrobial materials (such as copper & copper alloys) that are proven effective at reducing infection risk, yet whose use is safe for people and the environment.

Conference notes:

The resignation on February 19th 2022 of a Solihull councillor, following allegations of sexual harassment against them;

That resignation means that all disciplinary processes cease, with no resolution for potential victims;

That the councillor continued to represent Solihull Green Party for five months after the matter was first brought to GPRC’s attention; and

The ongoing and significant organisational and reputational damage to Solihull Green Party and its councillor group.

Due to the manifest and unresolved failures in process this situation has exposed, Conference urgently instructs GPEx to:

Organise a review into the Party's actions from the point the matter was formally raised, to the point of resignation. The review should be independent of GPRC, GPEx, DC and DRC; and

Consider what budget can be allocated to such a review.

The review will detail:

For noting in the Management Coordinators report to Autumn Conference 2022:
How the public was jeopardised by the Party’s actions;

Urgent suggested changes to the Constitution and Standing Orders to mitigate future risk and ensure the safety of our members;

As part of the final report:

How to implement an independent disciplinary process for all allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault;

Guidance to local parties for handling sexual harassment allegations, including clarity about who should be responsible for taking steps to protect members and the public; and
Any other suggested changes to the Constitution and Standing Orders.

The report should be published on the Members’ website by Spring Conference 2023, appropriately redacted for confidentiality.

## Synopsis
The separate election for Deputy Leader in 2022 identified a gap in our gender balancing rules leading to no women being on the ballot. This motion corrects that for all roles elected in the Annual Ballot.

## Motion
In Section 9 of the Constitution (Annual Ballot), amend Clause 9(iii) which currently reads:

“The nominations for all posts included in an Annual Ballot shall open at 10.00 on the first week-day in June and close at noon on the last week-day in June.  Voting shall close on receipt of the last post on the last week-day of August or five week-days before the start of the Autumn conference, whichever is the sooner.”

So that it reads:

“The nominations for all posts included in an Annual Ballot shall open at 10.00 on the first week-day in June and close at noon on the last week-day in June. Where there are posts where there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are women or gender diverse, noting that gender is self-determined, or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are people of colour, nominations will reopen for these posts. In this scenario, nominations must reopen within 3 working days of nominations closing, and must remain open for at least one full week. In this extended nomination period, nominations will only be accepted from candidates who fit the criteria leading to the reopening of nominations. Voting shall close on receipt of the last post on the last week-day of August or five week-days before the start of the Autumn conference, whichever is the sooner.”

## Synopsis

## Motion
SOC note: This motion did not receive sufficient coproposals.
{:.alert .d-inline-block .alert-defeated}

This interim policy was approved by the GPRC Policy Approvals Group last August and failed to get to conference. It was therefore placed in the interim policy forum for discussion, debate and consultation, prior to posting here for going to spring conference 2023.

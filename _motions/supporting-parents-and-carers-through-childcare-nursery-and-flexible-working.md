**Childcare and flexible working**

Parents and carers of children perform a vital economic and social function nurturing the next generation. Despite recent improvements in access to childcare, current access is still limited.

Childcare including breakfast and after school clubs remains prohibitively expensive for low-income or even middle-income families.

Parents and carers of children need the time to work, study and seek employment for the long-term benefit of themselves, their children and wider society.

A recent report by IPPR has shown that the economic benefits of providing wrap around childcare for low income out weigh the costs.

The current system is complex, expensive to administer and difficult for parents to navigate.

**Suggest policy on childcare provision**

Give all parents and carers access to 48 hours childcare during their children’s primary education including the pre-school year before reception.  Childcare would be available from 8am to 6pm.

Give all children access to a nursery place from aged one for thirty five ours a week.

Childcare should be funded through a single means tested benefit for all children between the age one and leaving primary education.

The benefit would be paid directly to the organisations providing care. These organisations would need to meet minimum standards in terms of staffing including training and facilties.

This benefit would enable childcare that would include

* Nursery and pre–school provision from the age of one.
* Wrap around care for school aged children, including both breakfast clubs and after school care.
* All school aged children would get an annual allowance during school holidays to attend four weeks of activity that support play, sport and cultural activity.

Not-for-profit provision in childcare would be actively encouraged through tax breaks and incentives. This is to avoid the risk to an important pubic service provision from speculative providers

**Suggest policy on flexible working and employment**

* All employment to be advertised as flexible to support parenting unless there is a clear business case for non-flexible working for a role.
* There will be incentives for employers who provide support facilities at the workplace such as childcare, job-sharing, flexible working, counselling and family planning.
* Parents or carers of disabled children would enjoy the same rights to reasonable adjustment as an employee who was themselves disabled.

**Suggest short term changes to policy on parental leave**

Maternity leave should be extended to 12 weeks at 90% pay and the remaining maternity benefit should be paid at the same level as the national minimum wage.

Paternity leave should be extended to 6 weeks at 90% pay.

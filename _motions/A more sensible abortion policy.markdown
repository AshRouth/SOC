Motion synopsis:


The current Green Party policy on abortion (HE700 to HE706 inclusive), in line with our stance on tackling discrimination and the causes of it, should be amended so that a Green Party government will not permit abortions based on the sex of the foetus, or foetal disabilities which are not [Note from SOC - Synopsis word limit reached]



Motion text:


in HE704 replace the words “anti-choice” with “pro-life”.


Delete HE705 and replace with:


"HE705: The Green Party believes that allowing abortions based on sex, non-fatal congenital disability, non-fatal foetal abnormalities, and other protected characteristics encourages discrimination against children and adults, and therefore that abortions on those specific grounds should be prohibited. The Green Party furthermore believes that time limits on abortions are there for sound medical reasons, that premature babies born at and slightly before 24 weeks have survived, and therefore that abortions after 24 weeks should only be carried out where it is medically necessary to do so e.g. if the pregnancy endangers the mother’s life or where a fatal foetal abnormality is diagnosed."

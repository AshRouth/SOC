## Synopsis

In light of the Governmentâ€™s continuing Road Investment Strategies (RIS2 and RIS3), it is critical to oppose the resulting increase in road construction, and the greenhouse gas emissions expansion generates. This motion commits the Green Party to oppose and campaign against all projects that expand the Strategic Road Network.

## Motion

Insert into the Record of Policy Statements:

Conference Notes:

That an expanded Strategic Road Network will increase private motor vehicle use, through induced demand and car dependency, and will not reduce congestion, pollution or carbon emissions.

That mass car ownership and the completion of the projects within RIS2 and RIS3 which propose to expand the Strategic Road Network are not compatible with carbon neutrality regardless of whether the vehicles using them rely on an electric motor or an internal combustion engine.

That the future of sustainable travel lies in publicly owned public transport, commonly owned cars in the form of car clubs and active travel.

That the existing road network needs retrofitting to LTN 1/20 standard or better, to accommodate active travel.

Conference Resolves:

To oppose and campaign against all expansion of the Strategic Road Network and to oppose the projects within both RIS2 and RIS3 which aim to expand the Strategic Road Network.

To campaign for the expansion of the rail network and active travel networks across the UK.

To instruct the Green Parliamentarians to oppose the projects within both RIS2 and RIS3 which aim to expand the Strategic Road Network in Parliament.

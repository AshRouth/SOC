## Synopsis
Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows the need a new view of Russia and a new strategy for peace in Europe. The new view is that Putin's Russia is a conscious, self-declared enemy. The new strategy is to defend the independent states, especially the democratic states, of Eastern Europe.

## Motion
1. This conference deplores Russia's record of aggression and support for tyrants. It condemns both the aggression and the war crimes that flow from it.
2. In the short-term conference urges the UK government to work with all willing countries, and especially with the EU, to:
    - Support the Ukraine's resistance to aggression by providing weapons, ammunition, training, logistics and intelligence as needed, as well as humanitarian aid.
    - Expand and intensify financial and trade sanctions against Russia and Belarus and individuals linked to their leaders.
    - Support the collection of evidence of war crimes.
    - Instigate a crash programme, based on green policies, to:
        * Eliminate Western Europe's dependency on Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2023.
        * End all UK purchases of Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2022.
        * End all UK purchases of food and fertiliser from Russia and Belarus by the end of 2022.
3. And in the longer term to
    - Prosecute anyone who commits or instigates war crimes
    - Strengthen and, if asked, expand NATO.
4. Conference recognises that it is no longer right to regard Russia as a badly-behaved neighbour. Putin's Russia is a self-declared enemy of liberal values and rights including the rights to free speech, fair trials and free elections.
5. And in the longer term to:
    - Recognise the threat that our dependency on fossil fuels makes to world peace and civil rights as well as to the climate.
    - Adopt the full Green New Deal since these are the policies that are now needed to address the linked crises caused by the war in Ukraine.
    - Reduce the UK's dependency on imported food.
6. Amend the Peace and Defence chapter of the PSS thus: \<to follow\>.

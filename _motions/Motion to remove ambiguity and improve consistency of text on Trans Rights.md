## Synopsis
To add a clause to the second sentence in paragraph RR530, to make clear this is a statement of gender identity and to remove any possible ambiguity of meaning when taken in isolation. In third sentence, also change word to “valid” as consistent with what’s just been said.

## Motion
Current RR530 

RR530 The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people's identities as real. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

In the second sentence, add after the first "that", “as statements of gender identity,”

Replace, at end of third sentence, “real” with “valid”.

Amended text now reads:

RR530 The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that, as statements of gender identity, trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people's identities as valid. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

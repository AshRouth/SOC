## Synopsis
The present Housing Crisis requires a ban on evictions. Support for Tenants taking direct action, House build to relate to need.  

## Motion
From soaring food and energy prices to runaway rents and mortgage rates, the cost-of-living crisis is impacting many millions of people.

The housing building policy of the UK Government is only designed to ensure developers rake in massive profits at the same time has tearing up open spaces and the green belt. We also note the concerns about many of the new build in terms of quality.

It’s a national scandal that ordinary people are paying the price for the rampant free for all of developers - with no access to the basic right of quality housing.

For most people, housing costs are their largest expenditure and with those in the private rented market also facing the sky-high rents and poor standards of housing quality.

A proper housing policy would see a government ensuring people are protected from rent debt, mortgage repossessions and homelessness.

This conference Is calling for an immediate eviction ban for all tenures, a stop to mortgage repossessions and a freeze on rising rents for private tenants. *Councils will set up a board to allow appeals by landlords in case of hardship cases.

The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) will support direct action by renters’ groups and communities to stop evictions.

Any new build will relate to the level of need in the area – taking into account housing waiting lists.

## Motion
SOC note: This motion has been ruled Out of Order.
{:.alert .d-inline-block .alert-defeated}

Standing Orders Committee (SOC) and Green Party Regional Committee (GPRC) are two of the most powerful and demanding bodies on the Party. For anyone to be members of both bodies risks conflicts of interests and an inappropriate concentration of power and influence.

This motion proposes to change the following phrase from Section 10 CONFERENCES Clause iv) of the Constitution of the Green Party of England and Wales from:

“(not more than two of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

to:

“(none of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

So Section 10. CONFERENCES Clause iv) now reads:

“iv) The SOC shall consist of not more than five members elected by Annual Conference (none of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

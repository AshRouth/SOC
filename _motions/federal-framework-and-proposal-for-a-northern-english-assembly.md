## Synopsis

In the United Kingdom, devolution has, for the most part, been a success... it has empowered nations, not least Scotland, to create a real sense of nationhood and allow powers to be decided closer to where they have the most impact. However, England remains the only nation of the United Kingdom not to have a devolved Parliament or Assembly and English affairs are decided wholly by the Westminster Parliament. This situation has created issues, not least the West Lothian Question, where Scottish MPs can vote on matters affecting England but not visa versa. So what is the solution? A Federal Framework for the UK.

## Motion

Insert new PA405 under the new heading: The Northern English AssemblyPA405 Subject to a referendum of the citizens living within it, Northern England should create a directly elected National Assembly to represent its people and help devolve powers away from Westminster.

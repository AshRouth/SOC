## Synopsis
In early August, a new campaign coalition was launched by trade unions, politicians and community organisations to tackle the cost of living crisis, called Enough is Enough. This motion calls for the Green Party to lend its political support to this vital and growing movement through affiliating to the campaign.

## Motion
Conference notes:

Millions of families face a crisis this winter as the cost of living soars and real wages fall at record rates

On 8 August 2022, a new campaign called Enough is Enough was launched by a coalition of national trade unions and community organisations to tackle this cost of living crisis

Within three weeks of launching, 500,000 people had signed up to join the campaign, and increasing numbers of trade unions and civil society organisations have since signed up as affiliates

Enough is Enough have five key campaign demands: 1. A real pay rise, 2. Slash energy bills, 3. End food poverty, 4. Decent homes for all, 5. Tax the rich

The campaign has launched with plans to hold more than 50 rallies across Britain (the first of these already attracting audiences of hundreds and thousands in London, Liverpool, Glasgow and Norwich), forming local campaign groups, organising picket line solidarity and taking action against the companies and individuals profiting from the current crisis

A Green Party Co-leader has set out how Enough is Enough’s five campaign demands are fully in line with Green Party policy

The Green Party has a long history of affiliating to, engaging with, and jointly steering coalitions of trade unions and civil society organisations pushing for progressive change, such as the People’s Assembly Against Austerity

Conference believes:

Tackling the cost of living crisis and the broken economic system that underpins it will require building mass movements for progressive change

Mass movements like Enough is Enough are significantly strengthened when they have political support

As the only major political party with elected representatives across England and Wales that fully support all five Enough is Enough campaign demands, the Green Party can lend vital support to this important and growing movement and therefore has a responsibility to do so

Conference resolves:

To instruct GPRC to write to the Enough is Enough campaign issuing our strong endorsement of the campaign, offer of support and request to affiliate.

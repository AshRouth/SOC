## Synopsis

This motion introduces diversity criteria for local, regional and general election candidate selections.

## Background

* There is no climate justice without social, racial and economic justice.
* Society is not structured equally, meaning there is not equal access to opportunities.
* This is not to limit our targets for diversity but to aide being representative of the areas we stand in, having diversity amongst our candidates, and to encourage the representation of marginalised groups as set out below.
* Politics is under-representative of global majority individuals, disabled people, LGBTIQA+ people, women and young people under 30.
* Our internal policies must match external policies for social justice.

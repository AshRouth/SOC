## Summary

This motion is designed to facilitate the creation and management of the Framework for Ethics and Conduct.

## Motion

This motion supersedes the motions bought in 2015, 2018 and 2019 concerning the Framework for Ethics and Conduct, Framework Oversight Group and the Framework Oversight Body in the following areas:

Aims

The Framework of Ethics and Conduct for the Green Party of England and Wales will:

•	express our ethical philosophy, related codes of practice and supporting guidance

•	be a one stop shop for all such internal policies

•	cover legal, regulatory, or statutory compliance requirements

•	cover constitutional and/or other internal compliance requirements

•	cover guidance and good and ethical practice

Principles

1.2.  The principles on which the Framework is to be based are:

•	it should emulate the kind of code of ethics and conduct that would be adopted by an enlightened organisation

•	it should be useable on a daily basis by members and staff

•	it should be written in positive language not legalese  

•	all existing policies should continue to be overseen by the same bodies as now

•	any gaps discovered where new or updated policies seem to be needed should be referred to the relevant party bodies

•	the completed Framework is to be signed off by a two-thirds majority vote of Green Party Regional Council (gprc)

•	GPRC will be responsible for keeping the Framework up to date.

Format and Content

The format and content of the Framework is to be agreed by a two thirds majority of GPRC and the format is to be in line with the ongoing development of the members’ web site by the Central Office.

Creation of the Framework for Ethics and Conduct

The Framework Oversight Body and the Framework Oversight Group shall be abolished.  GPRC will be responsible in all aspects for content, creation and maintenance of the Framework.

Documents may be added to the Framework by one of the following methods:

•	A two thirds majority vote at conference

•	A two-thirds majority vote of GPRC, or any successor body

•	Or for matters which fall within its remit, by a two-thirds majority vote of The Green Party Executive, or any successor body.

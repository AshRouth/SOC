An E motion creating a policy statement to condemn extreme executive pay in companies such as Thames Water; reaffirm our policy to legislate for a 10:1 maximum pay ratio between the highest and lowest paid in every organisation (as in the 2019 manifesto); and call for companies to be required to include workers on board / remuneration committees.

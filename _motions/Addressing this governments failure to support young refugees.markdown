Motion


The Green Party of England and Wales believe that it is vital unaccompanied child refugees get support when they arrive on our shores.


Yet many young refugees are being held in hotels and intake centres across the south coast, waiting for a council to accept them into care through the national transfer scheme.


We applaud the small number of councils who, despite mass cuts to their budgets and the lack of available placements for children in care, do everything in their power to welcome young refugees into their area - and are exceeding the target set by Government. This includes Green-led Brighton and Hove and Solihull, where Greens are a powerful opposition. But many local authorities, often where Conservatives are in power, are failing to provide a warm, safe home for young refugees.


We welcomed moves from the Government to use their powers to make it mandatory that council's take take young refugees mandatory in November. However we are dismayed that this action was only temporary.


We therefore call on the Government to:


- make the rota through the national transfer scheme mandatory on a permanent basis, with no exceptions for local authorities to opt out


- address the causes of why young refugees are arriving on our shores, often with an extreme level of trauma


- reintroduce schemes which reunited young refugees with their families, such as the Dubs scheme


- address the lack of placements for all children in care, by funding council's to develop in house provision and restrict profit-making private residential homes and foster agencies

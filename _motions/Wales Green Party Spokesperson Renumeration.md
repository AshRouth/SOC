## Background
The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) is so called in recognition that Wales and England are two separate countries. At present Wales has a form of devolved government and a Parliament â€“ the Senedd. It is one of the strategic aims of GPEW that WGP should gain seats in the Senedd. After gaining 9 Councillors in the recent local elections, and taking into account the voting figures, WGP can realistically hope to gain Senedd seats in the Cardiff area. Greens in government in Wales and in England are a win-win situation, mutually helping our credibility and legitimacy.

The level of work that has to be undertaken by the Wales Green Party Spokesperson/Leader is high. Wales has its own forms of legislation, some of which is ahead of England and the UK (eg the Future Generations Act). As a country with its own Senedd/Parliament the level of work is akin to that of the leadership of any national party. With its own national political landscape, the S/L has to engage with all the various organisations of Wales. Within GPEW in recent years there has been a welcome integration of the Wales S/L into the leadership team, and this brings with it increased duties and demands. There is a kind of doubling up and liaison role that is necessary for the relationship to work.

This is obviously an increasingly workload for what is currently a volunteer position which means that many people from diverse backgrounds would be excluded from taking this role. This is causing difficulties for the current leader and puts off potential new candidates. This is an equality issue.

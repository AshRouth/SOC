## Synopsis
Greens in government in Wales and in England are a win-win situation, helping our credibility and legitimacy. Gaining Green Members in the Senedd is more possible due to voting system change. The funding of the Spokesperson/Leader of the Wales Green Party needs to be adequate to achieve this strategic goal.

## Motion
The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) recognises that Wales and England are two separate countries. At present Wales has a form of devolved government and a Parliament â€“ the Senedd. Gaining Green Senedd Members in Wales is a key goal in the GPEW political strategy. Currently, the  Spokesperson/Leadership role of Wales Green Party (WGP) is voluntary. With a separate political landscape and improved opportunities to get Senedd Members elected, the responsibilities, scale of work, and expectations of this role require commensurate funding. WGP Council are calling on conference to instruct GPEx to put renumeration in place for WGP Spokesperson/Leader on a par with the rest of the leadership team. The costs of this remuneration are to be met by GPEW in line with our strategic goals.

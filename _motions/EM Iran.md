## Synopsis
This motion focuses on the recent and disturbing events in Iran. At the time of publishing this motion, over 75 people have been unlawfully killed by Iranian Government security forces while protesting against the Government's abusive and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws and the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.

## Exceptional Circumstances
The exceptional circumstance for this Emergency Motion is the killing of Mahsa Amini on the 16th of September 2022 and the subsequent killing of more than 75 people protesting her death.

## Motion
Conference notes:

On the 16th September 2022, 22 year old Mahsa Amini died in police custody in Tehran, after being detained for allegedly wearing her hijab too loosely.
While in police custody, Mahsa was beaten and, according to her family, died as a result.
Protests have taken place across Iran since Mahsaâ€™s death, with human rights groups reporting a death toll of over 75.
Iranian authorities have imposed severe internet restrictions, banning access to social media and messaging platforms, attempting to restrict freedom of expression and prevent information being shared.
Conference calls upon Party Leadership and the Green Party Executive (GPEx) to take urgent action in light of recent developments in Iran and the Iranian government's state sanctioned violence towards women, girls, and others who are protesting against their abusive and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws.

Conference calls upon Party Leadership and GPEx to:

Use their platform to highlight the crisis in Iran and show solidarity with protesters.
Press the UK Government and all relevant government departments to publicly condemn the violence and unlawful force used by Iranian security on protesters.
Press the UK Government to immediately announce expedited safe routes to the UK for Iranian refugees affected by the recent state violence, and to provide appropriate accommodation and support on their arrival.

Document Text

Guidance to Identify Queerphobia

Queerphobia, as used in the context of this guidance, refers to any bigotry directed towards LGBTIQA+ people viewed through the lens of queer theory, it does not seek to label all LGBTIQA+ people as “Queer” which some still view as a loaded term. There are other terms used such as Lesbophobia, Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, Intersexphobia/Interphobia and Acephobia/Aphobia that refer to the bigotry faced by particular communities within the LGBTIQA+ umbrella these are all equally valid terms to use.

The working definition is as follows:

Queerphobia is a prejudice against the whole or a section of the LGBTIQA+ community or someone that is perceived to be part of the LGBTIQA+ community. It is based on the perception that a person’s or a group of people’s sex; gender identity; gender expression; or any kind of attraction (e.g. sexual, romantic, etc) for people of certain gender(s), including non-attraction, is invalid; harmful; or abnormal.

Taking into account the overall context, contemporary examples of queerphobia could include, but are not limited to:

Taking the actions of one or a few LGBTIQA+ people to represent an entire community.

Demanding or forcing a person who is LGBTIQA+ to explain or justify their identity.

Intentionally using a word, especially a (neo)pronoun or form of address, for a person who feels that it does not correctly reflect their gender, or purposefully omitting a word that affirms their gender.

Claiming there is a "conflict" between the human rights of the LGBTIQA+ community and those of any other group.

Advocating against LGBTIQA+ people having access to appropriate healthcare, for example, gender-affirming treatment. Or advocating for treatment that seeks to change someone’s identity, commonly known as conversion therapy.

Implying that not being LGBTIQA+ is “normal” or “natural” in a way that being LGBTIQA+ isn’t.

Misidentifying neutral terms that describe someone not having an LGBTIQA+ identity as insults, for example straight, monosexual, cisgender, allosexual, perisex or endosex.

Claiming it is harmful for children to have age-appropriate LGBTIQA+ education.

Insinuating a person is a danger to others based on being LGBTIQA+.

Saying that an LGBTIQA+ person is confused, in a phase, following a trend or being LGBTIQA+ for attention.

## **Synopsis**

The “Big Tech” companies have accumulated significant wealth and power, through operating in ways that existing Green Party policy does not fully address. This motion begins to address those gaps.

Background:

* Big tech firms have increasingly built privileged, dominant positions in the relationship between suppliers and users. They have then used these positions to either affect the flow of information (e.g. social media algorithms that promote or demote certain types of content and voices), and/or to extract excess profit from suppliers and/or users. They reinforce these positions by shutting out alternative services, by using information to privilege their services, and by making it very difficult for suppliers and users to switch to alternate platforms. Finally, if providers take too much of a “hands-off” approach, then they also risk exploitation by state (and non-state) actors who wish to e.g. undermine democracy or affect elections
* Governments across the world are starting to take action, for example in the USA, the EU and even in the UK: “The UK government has announced new legislation intended to prevent big tech firms from unduly dominating digital markets, and to hold firms more accountable to customer obligations.” ([ https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/big-tech-firms-face-10-turnover-fines-under-new-competition-law](https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/big-tech-firms-face-10-turnover-fines-under-new-competition-law)). The UK is, however, too small to unilaterally set global governance standards, and will need to work together with others (primarily the EU) to do so.
* The motion therefore sets out to set out the principles required to address these power imbalances, by seeking to open up dominant digital services to scrutiny and competition. Specifically, there will be new duties on how they operate that put more power in the hands of their suppliers and users, more transparency as to how they operate, and additional duties for the most systemically important platforms to proactively identify and manage risks of manipulation.

## **Motion**

The E-Commerce section of the Economy Policy of the Policies for a Sustainable Society is to be amended as follows:

Add:

EC1021 Digital services also bring significant risks to society, for example when they are used to control the interaction between suppliers and users. Control over these interactions can then be used to amplify disinformation or restrict specific opinions and voices. This control can also be used to extract excess profits as it places the digital service in a position of a monopsony with respect to its suppliers and/or a monopoly with respect to its users. Many digital services gain access to significant amounts of sensitive personal and commercial data from their suppliers and users, which is at risk of being exploited by the digital service provider directly, or by third parties if they gain unauthorised access to that data.

EC1022 Digital markets and services operate on a global or global region basis. The UK cannot therefore unilaterally define standards and regulations, as to do so would risk globally standardised services being removed from the UK market. We therefore recognise that the UK will need to work collaboratively with the global standard setters to define standards and regulations, most especially with the European Union.

### DIGITAL SERVICES

EC1080 Digital services are at the heart of our societies and economies.   They include, but are not limited to, online marketplaces and app stores, search engines, social networks, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, cloud services, interpersonal communications services, web browsers, virtual assistants, connected TV, and affiliated advertising networks.

EC1081 Digital services are therefore expected to be content source neutral and to interoperate with other digital services with minimised costs and other constraints.  They will have a duty to deliver data from willing senders to willing recipients, as efficiently and reliably as possible, and to use interoperable end-to-end encryption for all messaging.  They will have a duty to enable at minimised cost and effort the ability for suppliers and users to move to equivalent alternate digital services, including with all their associated data and assets such as purchased copyright media.

EC1082 Marketplaces and app stores specifically give providers enhanced power over both suppliers and customers.  We will regulate relevant marketplaces and app stores and their providers to:

* Maximise access for suppliers;
* Prevent unfair competition from marketplaces and app stores providers, including products, services and advertising;
* Require transparency on commercial terms;
* Minimise transaction and other associated costs and constraints for suppliers and customers on all platforms provided by the marketplace or app store provider;
* Support resolution of disputes between customers and suppliers.

EC1083 Digital services that act as online intermediaries for third-party content will be expected to have robust processes to manage issues with illegal content and disputes with users, including public reporting of issues and of their policies, processes and algorithms for content moderation.

EC1084 The largest digital services are especially powerful, and so require additional safeguards. This will include, but not be limited to, being required to analyse the systemic risks stemming from the use of their platforms and demonstrate publicly and transparently that they are operating effective mechanisms to address the identified risks (e.g. illegal content, privacy violations, manipulation of the democratic process etc).

### SOFTWARE COPYRIGHT

EC1100 To ensure that software is available and usable, copyright on software will end on the earlier of

* 20 years after first release; or
* 1 year following the copyright owner ceasing to provide support for the software.

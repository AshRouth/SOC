## Synopsis

A motion to make clear the Green Party’s support for proper workplace trade union recognition and collective bargaining, and specifically to abolish the Pay Review Bodies that currently make recommendations on pay for almost half of public sector workers.

## Motion

**This conference notes:**

* Just 17% of the UK public thought the Government did a good job of negotiating with trade unions to prevent public sector workers from going on strike earlier this year.\[1]
* Pay Review Bodies are used to obscure the role of Government in setting public sector pay, to avoid negotiation with trade unions and to undermine their role as the voice of workers.
* Decisions claimed to be based on objective recommendations from these bodies are in practice political decisions by the Government of the day, and frequently recommendations are ignored.
* Collective bargaining is standard practice across Europe, strengthening the role of trade unions and making pay negotiations more transparent. The TUC and unions like UNISON have consistently called for collective bargaining to replace the Pay Review Bodies.
* Trade unions in both the public and private sector face too many undemocratic obstacles to recognition and basic engagement with their members, being forced to hold meetings outside the workplace and barred from communicating information about industrial action.

This Conference resolves:

* To abolish the Pay Review Bodies and move towards a system of collective bargaining for the public sector, where Governments negotiate properly with trade unions to deliver annual pay awards.
* To reaffirm the Party’s commitment to providing independent trade unions with a statutory right of access to workplaces in order to speak to workers during their working hours.
* To repeal all anti-union and anti-strike laws since 1979, in line with other policy statements, to empower workers to organise and defend themselves collectively.

## Synopsis
This motion would add a section on Spokespeople to the constitution. This motion would outline that spokespeople are selected by the party (Co-)Leader(s) and Deputy Leader(s), following their elections. This motion will also outline Spokespeople’s expectations, accountability, etc.

## Background
The selection process of Spokespeople is unclear to those not in GPEx. As our Spokespeople are effectively seen as our Party’s ‘frontbench’, with Party (Co-)Leader(s) and Deputy Leader(s) are often held responsible for Party Spokespeople by the general public, there should be a clear selection process, by the Party (Co-)Leader(s) and Deputy Leader(s), and recall process of our Party’s Spokespeople.

## Motion
SOC notes: This motion will require a two-thirds majority to pass.

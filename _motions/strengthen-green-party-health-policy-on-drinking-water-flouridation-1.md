## Synopsis

New very robust data is now available from the U.S. Government National Toxicology Program, from which leading researchers are warning of the potential for “huge societal harm” from the expansion of fluoridation. Ministers have planned to expand populations of domestic water supply containing added fluoride by more than 1.6 million.

## Motion

Amend HE1103

HE1103 Currently states:

HE1103 The Green Party is opposed to the artificial mass fluoridation of drinking water which is being promoted by the Government. There is conflicting evidence on the benefits to dental health of this practice and major concerns on the cumulative negative wider health effects of total ingestion levels of fluoride. There are further concerns on the links with the chemical industry that supplies artificial fluoride and the compulsory nature of its addition to drinking water that denies consumer choice.

After: “mass fluoridation of drinking water” add “supplies.”

Delete all starting from “which is being promoted by the Government.” then add the following up to the end of “NTP Monograph 08. September 2022.” “:

Water fluoridation has strong proponents within the UK, creating a potentially unresolvable tension between dental public health and the science of the harmful effects of ingested fluoride. This means that fluoridation advocates in Government are unlikely to acknowledge the threat that it brings to communities.

A remarkable consistency of results was obtained from meta-analyses conducted on 59 studies from which a very thorough review by scientists of the U.S. National Toxicology Program concluded that there is an “inverse association between fluoride exposure and childrens IQ”.

The Green Party believes this is of sufficient concern at fluoride levels added to drinking water in the UK because there are other sources of ingested fluoride, and millions affected, and will act on and promote the view that there is a potential for adverse effects of huge public health significance from artificial water fluoridation and that it is mass medication and should be ended.

Note: The “review” referred to is “The Draft Monograph on the State of Science Concerning Fluoride Exposure and Neurodevelopment and Cognitive Health Effects: A Systematic Review. NTP Monograph 08. September 2022.”

So that it reads:

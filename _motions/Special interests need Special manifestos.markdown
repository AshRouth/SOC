## Synopsis

Typically our party publishes manifestos from our affiliated groups at election time. However the process at the last General Election was vague - with shifting timelines and goalposts. This motion seeks to formalise a process.

## Motion

Insert a new 13 vii into the Green Party Constitution and renumber.

13vii. The party shall also publish smaller community specific manifestos at a General Election.

These documents will be led by our partyâ€™s affiliated groups as recognised by the Equality and Diversity committee.

At the declaration of the election GPRC will be mandated to provide a clear timeline for approval and publication.

## Synopsis
Our complaints procedure is failing, causing undue stress to all parties and a loss of confidence in the process.

## Motion
Conference calls on the Disciplinary Committee to produce a tracking record of every formal complaint submitted and publish the statistical data on Green Spaces, together with the minutes of its meetings. The same statistics to be presented in an Appendix to their annual report to Conference. Such data to record the time-line for every formal complaint submitted from the date of receipt to the date of completion or closure

Conference calls on GPEX and management to provide all the necessary additional administrative support necessary to enable members of the Disciplinary Committee to carry out their mandate efficiently and duly implement their own Standing Orders

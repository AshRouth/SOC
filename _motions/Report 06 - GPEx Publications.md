## Motion
This report is split into two sections: my work on the editorial board of Green World, our membership magazine, and my work on GPEx, setting the budget, and scrutinising and guiding the implementation of the party’s goals.

Green World

As a party consistently ignored in both mainstream media and more alternative media, Green World is one of the few places to showcase Green policies, ideas, people, and successes and debate policies and strategy.

I sit on its editorial board (GWEB), working with other board members to ensure it is supporting the party’s aims by relaying our policies to a wider audience, providing a platform for members to inform and inspire each other, and showcasing the work of elected Greens at all levels. This year Green World has:
- Continued to grow its newsletter and social media platforms
- Showcased the work of elected Greens from peers to councillors, old and new and across the country
- Covered international news and affairs, such as the recent elections in France and Australia
- Been a vehicle for spreading our policies and increasing members’ engagement in forming them
- Been a bridge between the party structures and members, hosting columns from the chairs of GPEx and the Green Party Regional Council (GPRC)

Many thanks to board members Fran, Bea, Paul, Emma, Eve, and John, and to Charles and Emma at Resource Media.

GPEx: I’ve tried to be a critical and constructive member of GPEx, working hard to make sure that we’re taking the best decisions for the party and its members.

Legal cases
I remain concerned about the impact of avoidable legal cases on our finances and party morale. We cannot treat certain members discriminatorily because of their beliefs and we must be careful about opening ourselves up to yet more costly legal cases by failing to take into account the fact that gender critical beliefs are now protected by law.

The complaints system
I have continued to express my concerns that politicisation and inadequacies of the complaints system is driving membership dissatisfaction and a rise in legal cases and that proper funding is urgently needed to make sure it is efficient, non-partisan, and effective.

Democracy and accountability

I’ve continued to call for practical steps to increase transparency, accountability and democracy. I successfully pushed for a more in depth, deliberative budgeting process in 2021 which allowed more time for discussion and better informed decision-making. I will continue to push for other measures such as making the membership of all GPEx subcommittees - and the means to join them - available to all members. This is key because these subcommittees take crucial decisions and therefore necessitate greater scrutiny and accountability.

Diversity matters report
This report must catalyse much-needed change. The lack of representation of people of colour in key positions such as target candidates and the structural racism raised by many Greens of Colour requires consideration and action. Every person interviewed for the report mentioned the sex/gender divisions. The damaging head-in-thesand approach of ‘there is no debate’ has to make way for party structures that foster an atmosphere where members are respectful of each other’s opinions and differences, and where bullying and silencing tactics are not tolerated.

## Synopsis

## Motion
Conference ratifies the following text as an Interim Policy Statement

â€œAs an emergency measure to address both the acute fuel poverty crisis and the climate emergency, and to reflect the massive increase in profits of the North Sea oil and gas producers resulting from fuel price rises, to raise the Supplementary Tax on the profits of these producers from its current level of 10% to 35%, and to distribute this money through an immediate uplift in payments to people qualifying for income support schemes (Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Support for Mortgage Interest). While reflecting the 'Polluter Pays' principle, this emergency measure is not intended to replace the Green Party's wider policy on a comprehensive carbon tax.".

Conference instructs PDC to ensure a motion to update PSS accordingly is brought to a future Conference.

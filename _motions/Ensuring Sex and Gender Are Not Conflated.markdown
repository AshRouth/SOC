## Synopsis

Sex refers to biology which is immutable, gender is a social construction.
Discrimination against women may be based on their perceived sex, however there are aspects of discrimination females face based on sex not gender.

To address discrimination it is imperative that accurate sex-segregated data is collected.

Women's Rights

The Green Party calls for a review of the language used in law, in government bodies and NGOs to ensure that sex and gender are not conflated.

Gender is a term that cannot easily be defined in law, whereas sex has a clear meaning, and as the basis of female oppression is essential to be recorded in many circumstances.

Therefore when data is being collected and analysed to form policy in relation to women, attention should be paid to whether the data is segregated by sex or by gender, and sex segregated data must be collected in order to monitor the effects of biological sex with regard to womenâ€™s position in society.

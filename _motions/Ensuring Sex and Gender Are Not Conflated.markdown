Synopsis


Sex refers to biology which is immutable, gender is a social construction.
Discrimination against women may be based on their perceived sex, however there are aspects of discrimination females face based on sex not gender.


To address discrimination it is imperative that accurate sex-segregated data is collected.

The Green Party calls for a review of the language used in law, in government bodies and NGOs to ensure that sex and gender are not conflated, and that accurate terminology is used where relevant which recognises that the category 'woman', which was formerly a sex based category, is now, by some parties, considered to be gender based.
When data is being collected and analysed to form policy in relation to women, attention should be paid to whether the data is segregated by sex or by gender, and sex segregated data must be collected in order to monitor the effect of the alteration in the categorisation of women is having on women

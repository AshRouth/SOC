## Synopsis
The Education chapter of Policies for a Sustainable Society hasnâ€™t undergone a full review in over a decade. Many policies are now in need of updating, adding to, rewriting or re-discussing, including those relating to academies, assessment and the climate emergency.

## Motion
This Conference instructs the Policy Development Committee to initiate a policy development process to rewrite and update the whole Education chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society. The process will involve seeking the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in relevant fields, as well as the views of other relevant organisations, academics and professionals.

# S﻿ynopsis

The pausing of referrals to the Northern Regional Gender Dysphoria Service is yet another barrier for transgender people accessing healthcare in an already broken system, and this must change

# M﻿otion

Enter into the Record of Policy Statements:

The Green Party is deeply concerned about the pausing of referrals to the Northern Regional Gender Dysphoria Service, which covers Tyne & Wear, Northumberland, Cumbria, Durham, Darlington and Tees Valley.

The pausing of referrals represents yet another barrier to trans people accessing the healthcare they are entitled to, and will contribute to yet more distress among people on the already long waiting lists.

The Green Party recognises that the waiting lists for Gender services all across England and Wales are far too long, and believe that transgender people deserve quick and quality healthcare.

While the Green Party acknowledges that the current system is broken and cruel towards trans people, we believe the pausing of referrals worsens the wider trans healthcare crisis going on.

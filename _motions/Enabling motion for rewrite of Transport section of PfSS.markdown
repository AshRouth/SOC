Synopsis


The Transport chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society had its last full rewrite about 20 years ago. It needs to be refreshed and updated. A previous enabling motion has elapsed so another is needed to enable the rewrite.


Motion


This Conference instructs Policy Development Committee to initiate a policy development process to rewrite and update the Transport chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society. The process will be undertaken by the Transport Policy Working Group, which should seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in relevant fields, as well as the views of NGOs and other relevant organisations and professionals.

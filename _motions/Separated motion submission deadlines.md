## Synopsis
Standing Orders for Conduct of Conference (SOCC) doesn’t specify a deadline for co-proposals. Consequently, the First Agenda deadline tends to be used. This creates a bottleneck for both Standing Orders Committee and motion proposers. This amendment sets the co-proposal deadline at one week after the First Agenda deadline.

## Motion
In Standing Orders for Conduct of Conference: Insert new D3.2: “D3.2 Nine weeks. The deadline for co-proposals to motions shall be not later than nine weeks before the first date of the upcoming Conference. Co-proposals to motions may not be submitted until after the First Agenda deadline.” Renumber subsequent clauses accordingly.

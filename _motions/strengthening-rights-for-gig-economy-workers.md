## **Synopsis**

A motion to improve and update policy on the rights of platform workers (workers engaged by platforms in the so-called ‘gig economy’) to provide proper legal protections. It covers the classification of workers in law, the regulation of platform employers and enforcement of the same.

## **Motion**

Conference notes:

* Platform workers lack fundamental protections in UK employment law, owing to the overall weakness of workers’ rights and the misclassification of millions of workers as independent contractors.
* Platform employers have used their scale and access to capital to flout legal protections for workers, many of which were designed in an era when app-based work did not exist.
* Existing laws, including the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Trade Union Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, offer loopholes for bosses to exploit.
* Existing regulations are insufficiently enforced by public authorities, leaving workers exposed to mistreatment and without recourse to the law when needed.
* Platform employers are complicit with police forces, licensing authorities and immigration authorities in targeting minoritised workers and especially those with precarious immigration statuses.

Conference believes:

* The advent and expansion of platform employment, without the empowerment of workers, has led to workers being atomised and more vulnerable to exploitation in multiple industries.
* Platform workers deserve total and complete protection from abuse and exploitation, and empowerment to unionise and defend each other.
* Public authorities should be providing protection to workers, leading regulatory enforcement against malpractice, and actively creating space for workers to organise in independent trade unions and take collective action.
* Each worker should have complete, and and equal, access to and use of the law to uphold their rights.

This Conference resolves:

* To reform employment law to close loopholes, bring platform workers under its protection under a single legal status of ‘worker’, with full and equal rights from the first day of employment.
* To increase funding to legal aid to ensure everyone can uphold their employment rights in court if necessary.
* To repeal all anti-union and anti-strike laws since 1979 in line with other recent policy statements, to empower workers to organise and defend themselves collectively
* To create a legal duty for other public authorities, especially licensing authorities, to suspend and ultimately remove operating licences for any company that repeatedly breaks the law in regard to workers’ rights.
* To end the hostile environment and the racialised targeting of platform workers by police forces and immigration authorities.

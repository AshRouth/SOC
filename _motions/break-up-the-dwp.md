## Synopsis

This mention is to call for two new depts to take over responsibility for the DWP, which has become a hated and feared dept. Dept of Pensions and Dept of Work and Employment!

## Motion

To be disabled in 21st-century Britain has many pitfalls, and while in some respects things have improved, one area that strikes fear is a call from the DWP, whose interest seems many to consist of coursing those on benefits back to work or forcing a continuous and humiliating serene of tests to prove you are one of “the deserving poor” this can not go on!

It is proposed that the DWP is not fit for purpose and, therefore, should be disbanded… in its place, two new departments will take over responsibility. The dept of Pensions for dealing with the elderly and pensions. The Dept of Work and Employment to carry over the Job Center (renamed the employment office). Responsibility for disability payment and other disability-related duties is to be transferred to the Minister of State (Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work). It should be noted that our asylum and migration policy calls for the backup and reorganisation of the home office, so this is Green Party policy for the reorganisation of government departments.

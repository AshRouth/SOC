Synopsis


The heavy promotion of games of chance and gambling is an intrusion into our lives, causing pain and misery to families. Current measures are insufficient to curb the influence of gaming companies nor their appeal to young and vulnerable groups. We would introduce a complete ban on all promotional activities.


Motion


Insert into the Culture, Media and Sports section of the Policies for a Sustainable Society new paragraph CMS688:


“The prolific promotion of gaming activities, particularly targeted at sports fans, is of great concern. We believe that the current regulations are insufficient at protecting young people and other vulnerable groups from the attraction of gambling. A Green government would implement a total ban of the promotion of all gaming activities in England and Wales“

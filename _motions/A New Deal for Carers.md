## Synopsis
Carers save the UK economy billions a year, it’s about time they got a fair deal. This motion would specify what changes we would make to unpaid carers lives in the UK.

## Background
SOC note: The below text has been removed from the motion text and added as background.

“That the cost-of-living crisis is disproportionately affecting unpaid carers. Carers UK estimates that the number of unpaid carers has risen to 10.6 million, meaning 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 12 young people care for those around them. People of colour, disabled people, elderly people and LGBTIQA+ people who care are impacted worse financially and socially. Unpaid care is worth £193bn a year whilst austerity cuts to social care is massively affecting unpaid carer. To add insult to injury, Carers Allowance is means tested, is unavailable to under 16’s and those in full time education and is removed from the cared for persons welfare payments.

Carers, including young carers, deserve a better deal from government. Supporting carers of all ages is vital.

To do this the current carers allowance payment needs to be increased to a living wage for the hours of care provided and young carers should have the right to be compensated by government, supported in education and be provided with respite written into law.”

## Motion
Conference therefore:

·       Insert in the PfSS at the end of ‘SW905’ to say “…and supports the increase of Carers Allowance to a £15 an hour living wage for unpaid care provided, including by young carers, and supports the removal of means testing and the removal of parts of the cared for persons welfare payments”

·       Add to the PfSS: ‘SW909’ into the education policy document, stating “The green party acknowledges that carers who are members of one or more oppressed groups are more likely to suffer social, economic and health affects due to their caring.”

·       Add to the PfSS: ‘SW910’ into the education policy document, stating “The Green Party recognises that Young Carers are poorly supported in education, and therefore would mandate in law that all schools must have a ‘Designated Young Carers Lead’ to provide support.”

## Synopsis

This motion proposes that the Economy Chapter of PSS be reviewed as a whole so it can lay out the party’s policies for a well-being economy clearly, concisely and consistently.

## Motion

Conference instructs Policy Development Committee to facilitate policy development, which will be delegated to the Tax & Fiscal Policy Working Group and the Economy Subgroup of the Climate Emergency Policy Working Group. Together they will bring a Draft Voting Paper and Voting Paper to future conferences to revise the Economy Chapter and propose changes to other chapters to ensure consistency.

The updated chapter will use the framework of a Wellbeing Economy and ensure that policies align to the goals of achieving a socially just and environmentally sustainable society. It will also clarify the role that tax and government finance play in reaching zero carbon.

On taxation, the new chapter will broadly retain the purposes and principles set out in the current Tax & Fiscal Policy section (EC700-705) as well as the principles of the party’s monetary policy (EC660-679) and will seek to resolve the current inconsistency between these.

The new Economy Chapter will aim to be under 5,000 words. Additional information will be in a background paper.

The Tax & Fiscal Working Group and the Economy subgroup of the Climate Emergency Policy Working Group will seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in these fields, and the views of external and other relevant organisations, including those of the Green Parties of Scotland and Northern Ireland, professionals in the field as well as other internal groups recognised by the party.

The provisional structure will be as follows, within which we will aim to develop a logical and compelling “story” or “flow”, making it easier to be followed by interested parties both within and outside the Green Party:

•	Background/Context

•	Principles

•	Aims

•	Our Economy

o	International Context

o	Fiscal Policy

o	Taxation Policy

o	Banking and Financial Regulation

o	Intellectual Property

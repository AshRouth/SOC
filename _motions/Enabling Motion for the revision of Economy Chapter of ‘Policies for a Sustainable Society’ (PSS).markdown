The Tax and Fiscal PWG and Economy Sub Group of Climate Emergency PWG are jointly posting this draft enabling motion to revise the Economy Chapter of PSS (see pdf). It is worth noting that Economy Chapter is currently ~12,000 words (which makes it one of the longest PSS chapters) and was last reviewed as a whole in 1990.


The exact scope, aims and and constraints that are included are still being discussed (see comments on pdf draft). We welcome comments on these issues and enabling motion more generally before the 14th Dec, so we can finalise wording before deadline on 17th.


There are concerns about whether even the two groups combined have enough volunteer time/skills/diversity to take on reviewing the chapter as a whole. So we welcome new members to both groups to help with this project, and would like to point out that you don’t need economic or tax expertises to make a valuable contribution. There is lots of work required to just facilitate the process as well as work writing, reviewing and checking policy.

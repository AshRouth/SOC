## Synopsis
The Constitution requires the Party Executive to meet "at least once every six weeks". Short Campaign periods last six weeks, which means convening a meeting either during, or immediately before and after, Short Campaigns. This motion improves flexibility of timetabling Executive meetings which have to fit around the schedules of other committees.

## Motion
Conference agrees to the following amendment to the Constitution of the Green Party:

In Section 7viii, delete "at least once every six weeks."

and replace with:

"a minimum of six times a year, at least once every nine weeks."

So the whole paragraph 7viii reads as follows:

"The Party Executive shall meet as necessary and a minimum of six times a year, at least once every nine weeks."

## Motion
Conference recognises that the Green Party is unlikely to secure additional Members of Parliament until the system of voting is changed so that the number of MPs representing a party in parliament is broadly commensurate with the proportion of the popular vote secured by the party.

Conference also recognises that until such a system of voting is introduced, the main role of the party is to maximise our representation in local government and influence national policy as much as possible through our existing parliamentary representation.

Accordingly Conference proposes that, in the next general election, local parties in constituencies which could realistically be won by another progressive candidate are encouraged to enter discussions with the candidate and their local party on the basis that the Green Party will not nominate a parliamentary candidate subject to the candidate agreeing to

1. support a bill to introduce a proportional representation voting system in the next parliament
2. support a "Green New Deal" providing for a massive expansion of public investment in green industries in order to decarbonise energy and transport and work towards a target of net zero carbon for the UK by 2030
3. publicly acknowledge and thank the Green Party for lending its support in what will be a crucial parliamentary election for the future of the UK.

DC may update SOPD and provide these updates to conference for approval. These updates will seek to help improve the current process. As stated at last Autumn Conference when it agreed to increase the size of DC from 11 to 22, we stated that this was only one way to help improve things.

These changes are still being worked on and will be posted here as soon as possible.

As usual, we welcome any constructive suggestions on this topic.

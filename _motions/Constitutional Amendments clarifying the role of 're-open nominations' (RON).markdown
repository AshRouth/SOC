## Synopsis

The role of the ‘Re-Open Nominations’ (RON) option as a negative option in internal Green Party elections serves the purpose of allowing members have the opportunity to register their dissatisfaction with all available candidates. This clarifies the role of ‘RON’ and ensures it is not treated as a candidate.

## Motion

In 17(ii), delete “such an event”, substitute “all elections and candidate selections at national, local and regional levels within the Party”; delete “in a form to be decided by SOC from time to time”, substitute “by the inclusion in the ballot of the option of Re-open Nominations (RON)”. Add at end “RON shall remain a live option throughout the count, and shall not be eliminated at any stage.”

17(ii) as amended would read:

17(ii) In all elections for SOC, Policy Development Committee, Campaigns Committee, International Committee, the Dispute Resolution Committee, Equalities & Diversity Committee, the Regional Council, and the Party Executive there will be an election, even when there are no more candidates than positions to be filled. In all elections and candidate selections at national, local and regional levels within the Party provision will be made for negative voting, by the inclusion in the ballot of the option of Re-open Nominations (RON), such that if any candidate receives more negative than positive votes such candidate shall not be elected. RON shall remain a live option throughout the count, and shall not be eliminated at any stage.

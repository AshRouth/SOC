## Synopsis

This Motion commits the Green Party to actively oppose the EAPB Bill as it undermines the democratic right of public bodies to seek peaceful means to promote human rights and climate justice and calls on the Party to support the Right to Boycott Coalition.

## Motion

1. Conference calls on elected Green Party members and those in the House of Lords to take every opportunity to proactively oppose the Government’s Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill that passed its second reading by a majority of 268 to 70 on July 3rd 2023.

This toxic piece of legislation will prevent public bodies from making their own ethical decisions on investment and procurement as a peaceful and democratic way of exerting pressure on companies that undermine human rights, employment rights and the need to combat climate change. (1)

2. Conference reiterates its support for active participation in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Campaign as contained in the Green Party Conference resolution 2014. This called on the Green Party:

‘to reiterate our calls on the UN, the EU and the US government to ensure that Israel complies with international law and to support these calls by active participation in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.

The campaign asks individuals, organisations, councils and governments to refuse to deal with companies and institutions identified as facilitating Israel's military capacity, human rights abuses or illegal settlement activity.’ (2)

3. Conference notes the Opinion submitted to the Labour Party by Richard Hermer KC of Matrix Chambers on the Bill (Conclusion):

‘What can be said with a high degree of certainty is that many of the key provisions of this very poorly drafted Bill are deeply troubling from both a domestic and international law perspective.  The implications for local democracy, for the proud history in our regions of campaigning for global human rights, for using our economic clout for the promotion of human rights, for free speech in this country and for compliance with our international law obligations are potentially profound.’ (3)

4. Conference endorses the view of Caroline Lucas MP stated in an article for Left Foot Forward on July 4th 2023:

‘\[The Bill’s] wordy title disguises its deeply dangerous nature – this is an anti-boycott Bill, sitting alongside reams of recent legislation rolling back the right to strike, the right to protest, and the right to seek asylum, to form a co-ordinated attack on democratic principles. Alarmingly, it will also undermine a wide range of campaigns for social and climate justice.’ (4)

And notes her support for the cross-party **Early Day Motion 1415** on the Bill (4a)

5. The Green Party will actively support the 60 organisation strong Right to Boycott Coalition that comprises trade unions, faith organisations, human rights and climate justice campaigns and many others, in their efforts to defeat this Bill. (5)

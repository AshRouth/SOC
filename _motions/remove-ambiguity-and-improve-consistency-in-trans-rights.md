## Synopsis

To add a clause to the second sentence in paragraph RR530, to make clear this is a statement of gender identity and to remove any possible ambiguity of meaning when taken in isolation. In third sentence, also change word to “valid” as consistent with what’s just been said.

## M﻿otion

Current RR530

RR530 The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people's identities as real. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

Add, at end of second sentence, “all as statements of gender identity.”

Replace, at end of third sentence, “real” with “valid”.

Amended text now reads:

## SYNOPSIS

Policy amendments following the decisons of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) agreed in Montreal in December 2022 (COP 15). The government of the day signs on behalf of the UK and so is required to implement its decisions. Further consideration of the GBF is expected to lead to future amendments.

## MOTION

Conference instructs the Policy Development Committee to make the following changes to the Wildlife and Habitats chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society (PfSS).

**Insert at the end of the first clause of WH003** Text reading: ‘which are either in step with or, in some cases, exceed the Global Biodiversity Framework “30 by 30” targets.’ so that the clause reads: WH003: ‘Green Party Policy for the Regeneration of Nature aims to achieve the following outcomes, which are either in step with, or in some cases, exceed the Global Biodiversity Framework “30 by 30” targets.’

**Insert at the end of clause WH102**: ‘These targets will align with and be at least as ambitious as the “30 by 30” targets set in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Global Biodiversity Framework 2020-2030.’ So that the clause reads: ‘WH102 The Commission for Nature will set and monitor the delivery of short, medium and long-term targets in the Environment Act 2021. These targets will align with and be at least as ambitious as the “30 by 30” targets set in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Global Biodiversity Framework, 2020-2030.’

**Insert in paragraph WH103**, after ‘the Rights of Nature Act: and in accordance with the UK obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity.’ So that the clause reads: ‘ WH103 The Secretary of State for the Environment will be required by the Rights of Nature Act and in accordance with the UK obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity, to produce and implement a strategy and corresponding budget to achieve the targets set by the Commission for Nature. This strategy will be informed by science and devised in collaboration with devolved governments, local authorities, other government departments, and major NGOs involved in nature conservation.’

## Synopsis

The Green Party is without a policy or set of rules on how members should conduct themselves on social media specifically. This motion would append the proposed Social Media Policy as an appendix to the Code of Conduct, meaning all members must adhere to it. This would make it equivalent to the Anti-Bullying and Harassment Policy, which is currently the only appendix (i) to the Code of Conduct, which was itself appended by a decision of Conference. Members could reference this policy for advice on how to conduct themselves, and members could cite breaches of this policy as breaches of the code of conduct in a complaint.

## Motion

INSERT the attached Social Media Policy as a new appendix to the Code of Conduct, Appendix (ii): Social Media Policy

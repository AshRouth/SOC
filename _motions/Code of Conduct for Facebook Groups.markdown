Synopsis

Motion


Huge amounts of disciplinary complaints come from behaviour online - and specifically from Facebook groups. Many of these Facebook groups are our shop window, and are how members and supporters interact with the party for the first time.


We would benefit from a clear set of guidance and rules for groups who wish to use the Green Party’s name or logo. As other political parties do.


I suggest we create a policy where groups wanting to use the Green Party logo and name must be affiliated and go through a process that involves signing up for a code of conduct. That code of conduct should include:


A total prohibition on discrimination against protected characteristics
Fair treatment of leadership and other election candidates


In return these groups get listed by the Green Party as official groups and get to use the logo. Any groups who don’t want to sign up to this process can still exist, they’re just asked not to use the Green Party name or logo.

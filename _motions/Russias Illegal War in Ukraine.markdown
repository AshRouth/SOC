The Green Party condemns Putinâ€™s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine and we send our solidarity to the brave people of Ukraine.

We reject the Russian claim that the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are anything other than parts of the sovereign state of Ukraine. We acknowledge that this conflict originated with the Russian aggression in Donetsk and Luhansk.

We call for the UK to follow the EU in waiving visa requirements for refugees of all nationalities fleeing Ukraine and to provide them with safe routes to sanctuary.

We welcome the package of sanctions announced so far, while noting that many are long overdue. We would extend sanctions to include a comprehensive export and import ban, including oil and gas, and immediate action to seize the assets of those close to the Putin regime.

Kremlin-linked interference in British politics through financial dealings at multiple levels, meddling in UK elections and connections in Parliament, are a corrupting force in British public life that must be addressed to protect our democracy and national security. The UK Government must urgently undertake a full investigation of the security threat posed to UK democracy by Russia.

Our failure to challenge Russian authoritarianism and the abuses of the Putin regime is linked to our addiction to fossil fuels. We must ensure that by next winter we have reduced our energy demand and massively increased our domestic energy supply.
We call on the Head of Communications to publish this statement widely.

It increases the size of Regional Council and introduces PR; and reduces GPEx and introduces a competence threshold.

<p>In Part 1, in (i) replace “culture, creating the political strategy, and directing the political direction of the Party in between conferences.”</p>

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> an amendment originally proposing the insertion of ‘GPC’ after ‘Green Party Council’ was recognised as a minor textual amendment and made by SOC of its own motion</p>

Delete existing clause iv)

iv)	The Regional Council shall consist of two members elected by postal ballot (as specified in Appendix C) by and from each constituted Region. Each term of membership of Regional Council shall be for two years commencing from the date of election by the individual Region. Such election shall be notified, in writing, to the Secretary of the Regional Council giving the date of election and confirmed by the Region’s Electoral Returning Officer. Such notice is to be given not less than two weeks prior to the next meeting of the Regional Council. 

and replace it with

iv)	The Council shall consist of 36 members.  Each council member’s term will be for three years and 12 people will be elected every year, using a single transferable vote process, as part of the annual ballot.  Any member who has been a member for over two years will be eligible to stand.

v)	No person can be elected to more than two full terms consecutively. Terms will be considered non-consecutive if they are approximately one year apart. Members elected to a shortened term at the first Annual Ballot or elected to a shortened term to fill a vacancy are not considered to be elected to a full term.

vi)	The Green Party Leader (or Co-Leaders), the Deputy Leader (or Deputy Leaders), the Wales Leader, and the Young Greens Co-Chairs will all be voting members of the Council. Where the position is a job-share, the role will have a single vote. The two Young Greens Co-Chairs will have one vote each. The Chair and Treasurer of the Executive, plus the CEO will be non-voting members of the Council.

<p>In iv)</p>

<p>insert before “36” in the first sentence: “ordinary”.</p>

<p>insert after “members” in the first sentence: in addition to the role holders outlined in section x below ; and delete “who has been a member for over two” and replace with “of the Green Party of England and Wales whose membership of the Party exceeds two continuous”.</p>

<p>So that it reads:</p>

<p>iv) The Council shall consist of 36 ordinary members in addition to the role holders outlined in section x below . Each council member’s term will be for three years and 12 people will be elected every year, using a single transferable vote process, as part of the annual ballot. Any member of the Green Party of England and Wales whose membership of the Party exceeds two continuous years will be eligible to stand.</p>

<p>Insert new sections vi – ix and renumber:</p>

<p>vi) In order to preserve the regional spread of the council, in determining the results of annual ballot to elect ordinary members of the council the following requirement will be applied. At the point of the calculating the results of the election each year, the results shall, subject to the caveats outlined in section viii, provide for there to be amongst the membership of the ordinary members of the council:</p>

<p>a. At least 1 member of Wales Green Party</p>

<p>b. At least 1 member of each English Regional Party</p>

<p>vii) If at the close of nominations set out in Section 16 Internal Elections and Annual Ballot, part 7 there are insufficient nominations submitted for election to the Council in order that the election can satisfy the requirements set out in part 4 above, then nominations will be re-opened and the requirements to satisfy the constitution published to all members. This re-opened nomination period shall close at noon 5 weekdays prior to the opening of voting.</p>

<p>viii) If following the extended nomination process detailed in section vii above, there are insufficient candidates on the ballot to satisfy the requirements set out in section vi above then the election shall proceed to elect the full number of ordinary members as required and will waive the requirements in section vi for this ballot for that particular region, or Wales, as applicable. There will be a significant communication campaign from the council over the subsequent year within the region(s) concerned, or Wales, regarding the need for candidates to put themselves forward.</p>

<p>ix) If a member of the council moves to a region of England where they had not been resident at the time of their election, or into Wales, they will continue to be a member of the council. At the next annual election, their current location of membership at time of nomination will be used to determine whether requirements under vi have been met.</p>

<p>To reflect changes made at the Wales Green Party EGM in July 2023 and ensure parity</p>

<p>In current vi), renumbered as above to x), Delete “Wales Leader” and replace with “Leader (or Co-Leaders) of the Wales Green Party, the Deputy Leader(s) of the Wales Green Party”.</p>

<p>So that it reads: x) The Green Party Leader (or Co-Leaders), the Deputy Leader (or Deputy Leaders), the Leader (or Co-Leaders) of the Wales Green Party, the Deputy Leader(s) of the Wales Green Party, and the Young Greens Co-Chairs will all be voting members of the Council.

Part Two

This motion calls on conference to amend Clause 7 of the constitution by deleting the existing Clause 7 and replacing it with the following:

GREEN PARTY EXECUTIVE 

i)	There shall be a Green Party Executive (hereinafter referred to as the Party Executive or GPEx) which shall be responsible for the overall and day-to-day direction of the Party. Certain duties and responsibilities are reserved to other Party bodies specified in this Constitution, in particular Conference, Standing Orders Committee, Green Party Regional Council, Disciplinary Committee, Appeals Committee and Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee. The authority of the Executive does not extend over those reserved duties and responsibilities.

ii)	The Party Executive shall consist of the following voting members: Leader plus Deputy Leader(s) or Co-Leaders, Wales Green Party Leader, the two co-chairs of the Young Greens as a job share and the additional members elected to the following functional positions, to serve for two years:

a)	Chair; 

b)	Treasurer; 

c)	Seven ordinary members.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) will be a non-voting member of the Executive.

iii)	Elections for the GPEx Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary member posts shall be by a ballot of all members of the party with voting included within the Annual Ballot.  The Chair and Treasurer shall be elected in one year in individual ballots by instant run off, at the same time as the Leader(s) plus Deputy Leader(s), and the ordinary members in the next year by a seven-seat single transferable vote, so that the two-year terms of the two groups are staggered.

iv)	Subject to the collective responsibility of the Executive set out in 7 i), 7 xvi) and elsewhere in section 7 or other clauses of the constitution, within one month of the election of the Ordinary Members, GPEx will set out what their areas of responsibility are such that between the Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary Members, GPEx takes accountability for all sub-committees of GPEx and their individual accountabilities are aligned to the Party’s structures and staff responsibilities. This will be done using an appropriate methodology, to ensure an acceptable workload and that each Party Executive’s skills are matches to their portfolio.

v)	Procedures for the election of Leader and Deputy Leader(s) or Co-Leaders of the Green Party and their duties and responsibilities are outlined in Section 8 of this Constitution. 

vi)	Candidates for the GPEx Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary Member positions shall have been a member of the Party for the two complete years preceding the date of close of nominations, and shall be required to complete a standard application form. Nominations of candidates must be supported by the signatures of a minimum of ten members of the Green Party of England and Wales. Or, if they have been a member for a minimum of one complete year preceding the date of close of nominations, their nomination must be supported by a majority of the Green Party Regional Council’s members in attendance at a quorate official meeting of that body. 

vii)	Members of the Party may be nominated for no more than one GPEx post at any one time, and no member may hold more than one post on the Party Executive at any one time. Members of the Party Executive may not hold any other elected office in the Party at national level. Members of the Party may be nominated for both Leader and Deputy Leader(s). 

viii)	The Party Executive shall meet as necessary and at least once every two months. 

ix)	A quorum of the Party Executive shall comprise a majority of the total membership eligible to vote. 

x)	The Party Executive may from time to time create such sub-committees as it considers necessary for the efficient conduct of its business and shall determine their terms of reference, powers, duration and composition at least annually, retaining responsibility for the conduct of such sub-committees and accounting for the conduct of those sub-committees to the Annual Conference. Any such sub-committee shall include at least one member of the Regional Council. 

xi)	The Party Executive shall appoint the following posts: 

a)	a National Election Agent; 

b)	The Party Executive shall nominate persons to Spokesperson roles, who shall each be responsible for covering a designated area of policy. They shall be appointed subject to ratification by the Green Party Regional Council, who may approve or reject any nomination. The Regional Council may recall any appointed Spokesperson. The Young Greens Co-Chairs shall be the Youth and Students Spokespeople.

c)	In addition the Party Executive may create such posts as it considers necessary. 

xii)	The Executive shall elect from among its elected members a deputy chair, to assist the chair in their duties, and to act in the role of the chair at any time when the chair is unable to do so. Such elections are to take place at least annually and by the end of November each year.

xiii)	By a two-thirds majority of its membership eligible to vote, the Party Executive may suspend from office any member of the Party Executive, if there is evidence of sustained conduct which in the opinion of the Party Executive is against the interests of the Party, subject to any decision of the Regional Council under Clause 6(xii) and subject to the right of such a member to appeal. 

xiv)	In the event of 20% of constituted Local Parties petitioning the Regional Council to recall the GPEx Chair, Treasurer or Ordinary Member, such a member shall be under suspension until a new ballot has been held for that post at a date to be determined by the Regional Council. 

xv)	In the event of a casual vacancy (i.e. one not arising in the normal electoral cycle) for a GPEx Chair, Treasurer or Ordinary Member position a replacement shall be appointed in an acting capacity by the Party Executive until the next scheduled ballot is held.  An acting replacement will not have voting rights

xvi)	The responsibilities of the Party Executive shall include the following at the national level:

a)	to implement the decisions of the Annual Conference;

b)	to ensure the proper financial oversight and administration of the Party and fundraising for its operations;

c)	to act as the Green Party’s employer of Green Party staff;

d)	to keep records of its business, which it shall provide to the Regional Council and make available to the membership of the Party;

e)	to present a full written report on its activities and on the financial state of the Party to the Annual General Meeting;

Transitions

GPRC

Following the passing of this motion we will transition to the new format of the Council as follows:

At the first Annual Ballot, only 12 Council seats shall be up for election.

At all future Annual Ballots, 12 seats shall ordinarily be up for election (the seats of the Councillors whose terms are expiring in that year) and the 12 Councillors elected shall serve for a three year term.

Any existing members of GPRC will transition to become full voting members of the Council, with their terms expiring in line with their existing mandate. If any such Regional Councillor is elected to the Council at an Annual Ballot, they shall immediately cease to be a member by way of this transition clause. If any Regional Councillor ceases to be a member of the Council, or is elected to the Council at an Annual Ballot, the region which elected them shall not replace them.

This clause shall be removed automatically once all of the following have taken place:

* The first Annual Ballot has concluded,
* The terms of any and all Regional Councillors have expired.

GPEx

At the next Annual Ballot following this motion being passed, those members standing down, comprising half of GPEx, will be replaced by the seven ordinary members elected as set out in this motion.

The accountabilities set out in Clause 7 iv) shall exclude the responsibilities of those members of GPEx who still have a year left to serve.

In the following Annual Ballot, the remaining half of the existing GPEx members shall stand down and elections conducted for the new Chair and Treasurer elected as set out in this motion.

Incorporation

Conference instructs GPRC through its Party Structure Working Group to bring back further motions to build on these changes to enable the incorporation of the Party.

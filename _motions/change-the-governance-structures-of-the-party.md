## Synopsis

This motion changes the composition of the Regional Council and the Executive in line with the pathfinder motion submitted to Conference in Autumn 2022 and the motions submitted to Spring 2023. It increases the size of Regional Council and introduces PR; and reduces GPEx and introduces a competence threshold.

## Motion
            

#### Incorporation

Conference instructs GPRC through its Party Structure Working Group to bring back further motions to build on these changes to enable the incorporation of the Party.

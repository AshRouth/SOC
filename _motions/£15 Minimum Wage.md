## Synopsis
A motion to support the introduction of a £15 an hour minimum wage for all workers and to support all trade union campaigns for a £15 an hour minimum wage.

## Motion
Insert into Record of Policy Statements:

The Green Party is disgusted that decades of Tory, Labour and Coalition governments have created a poverty economy. 14.5 million people in the UK are in poverty. 10% of full-time working-age adults are in poverty, rising to a third of working-age adults in families where there is only part-time work. These are the highest rates since records began. 90,000 people a year die in poverty in the UK.

The Green Party believes that in addition to innovative policy proposals like the Universal Basic Income, higher minimum wages and empowered trade unions are essential to securing a high standard of living for all.

The Green Party supports the introduction of a minimum wage of at least £15 an hour, for all workers no matter their age, to help tackle the cost of living crisis.

The Green Party supports all trade union campaigns for £15 an hour, and will stand in solidarity with them in fighting for higher wages and working conditions.

The Green Party will seek to introduce a minimum wage of at least £15 an hour after the next general election.

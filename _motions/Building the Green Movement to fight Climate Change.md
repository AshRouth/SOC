## Synopsis
The next General Election presents the Green Party of England & Wales (GPEW) a real opportunity to play a significate role in reducing the number of Tory MPs elected.

## Motion
Greens recognise that to fight climate change requires working with like-minded people in England and Wales and Internationally to build the green movement. We understand that 'Greens’ include members of other parties or none.

Elections are an important element of our activity and Greens must think strategically at the next General Election. Greens note that although the Tories are behind in the polls, this may be misleading under First Past the Post, risking the disaster of another Tory government.

Therefore, Conference believes the GPEW and Local parties need to consider the following at the next General Election:

Where Greens can win seats or make significant gains in vote share, and can safely stand without allowing the Tories to win, then we should stand. However, in more marginal seats Greens should not stand or should offer only paper candidates.

A decision not to stand would depend on the results of a survey/engagement with other parties aiming to defeat the Tory. The survey/engagement should be around the subjects of fighting Climate Change, Just Transition, PR, Austerity or a significant local issue.

The aim of this electoral tactic is to ensure that the Tories are defeated – so making progress in our aims and objectives as Greens.

The final decision should be that of the members in the said constituency. This can be done by ballot if possible or otherwise at a party meeting.

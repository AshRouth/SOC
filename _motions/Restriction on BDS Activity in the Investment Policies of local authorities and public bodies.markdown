Restriction on BDS activity in the investment policies of local authorities and public bodies

The amendment to ‘Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Bill’, proposed by Robert Jenrick MP received parliamentary approval on February 22nd, after the Final Agenda was published on February 11th.

It attached to the Bill ‘guidance or directions on investments which it is not proper for pension scheme managers to make in light of UK foreign and defence policy’.

Conferences notes:

The amendment established legislation preventing divestment of public service pensions from companies involved in human rights abuse abroad, through the arms trade or other ‘defence’ industries. The Green Party is deeply concerned about the impact that this may have on human rights and climate justice campaigns working on ethical investment and/or disinvestment.

The amendment is so broad that it could be easily weaponised against any human rights campaign raising concerns about pension investments in any company that is not formally on a UK sanctions list, for example: companies involved in illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory or companies involved in environmental and/or labour abuse through mining or other extractive industries.

Furthermore, Conference notes that Mr Jenrick has said that the UK Government is planning to make BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) illegal in the UK in a forthcoming Bill. Such action threatens theright to adopt peaceful means to pressure companies and others over human rights.

Conference calls on the Green Party, its parliamentary representatives, and elected councillors to campaign and vote against any restriction on BDS activity in the investment policies of local authorities and public bodies.

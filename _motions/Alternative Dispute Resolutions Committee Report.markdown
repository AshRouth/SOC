At the time of writing this report, at the end of 2021, there
has been little opportunity for significant developments
since Autumn Conference 2021.

### Membership of Committees

The following people were elected to the Committee:

• Vita Falbo-Ellis (first one-year term)
• Steve Hancox (second one-year term)
• Marisa Johnson (fifth one-year term)
• Jan King (second one-year term)
• Ron Meldrum (third one-year term)

Conference agreed changes to the constitution which
increase the number of committee members to a maximum
of seven, and extends the term of service from one year to
two, with a maximum of three years of consecutive service.
Standing Order Committee (SOC) agreed that two more
members could be coopted on the committee, and a search
has begun to find two more members, with a particular aim
to increase its diversity. To this end a role description has
been drawn up and distributed to invite expressions of
interest from people under-represented on the committee
at the present time.

### Admin Arrangements

At this time we do not have a nominated Coordinator for the
committee. The tasks of coordination are shared among
committee members. Communications are routed through
coordinator@drc.greenparty.org.uk

### Referrals

Since Conference we have received three referrals from
Disputes and Complaints Referral Group (DCRG), which
could not proceed to mediation either because parties did
not agree to it, or someone resigned from the party. We
received one self-referral, which is open at the time of
writing.

### Complaints Summary

Numbers received: 4
Mediations: 0
Open cases: 1

### Regional Network

We have updated the list of volunteers to ensure continued
interest and commitment. There are plans for further
training sessions for the volunteers, and more support for
regional developments.

### Other Work

ADRC contributes to the work of the Code of Conduct
working group, and the group looking at improving the
culture of the Green Party. Committee members contributed
individually to the independent review of the complaints’
system. There are good working relationships with GPRC,
DCRG, the Complaints’ Manager’s office and Discipline
Committee (DC).

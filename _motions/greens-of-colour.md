### Activities this year
#### UK Black Pride 
On Sat 19 Aug 2023, Greens of Colour will be co-hosting a stand at [UK Black Pride](https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/) in collaboration with the LGBTIQA+ Greens GPEW Liberation Group. 

#### Diversifying GPEW Membership, Officers, Candidates and Elected Representatives  
Greens of Colour (GOC) is currently looking into our role in working out strategies and processes that can support local parties to have a more diverse group of officers and target / non-target candidates, and build understanding that this depends on **a more consistent and long-term approach** to reaching out more widely and diversifying their membership. Following consultation with local party organisers, staff members, GPEx Local Party Support Officer and Equality and Diversity (E&D) Spokesperson, Naranee Ruthra-Rajan, Non-Portfolio Officer, has developed a suggested action plan that emphasises the need for genuine respect rather than tokenism, an understanding of intersectionality and the need for collaboration with GPEW Staff, other liberation groups and local parties. We aim to take a practical, supportive and holistic approach broken down into three main areas: 

1. Establishing a more thorough understanding of the current situation and examples of good practice, including looking at data collection and surveying local parties about current Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) practice
2. Planning a training package for local parties using a combination of in person and online sessions, guidance documents, videos 

a. Authentic community engagement - principles and in practice
b. Anti-racism and intersectionality
c. How to recruiting and support a more diverse set of candidates

3. Planning a support package for existing GOC candidates and elected representatives

We are pleased to note that this will join up with other efforts being made in the party to look at issues of class and the protected characteristics more widely. Discussions with GPEW staff have started and will continue in September 2023. 

#### Deyika Fund
The Deyika Fund board continues to meet and assess applications received and discuss how we can support more members. We have also explored how to make our application process more accessible including accepting video applications. We have continued to promote the fund and utilised Spring conference to distribute leaflets to local parties to encourage their members to apply. We will continue this at Autumn conference with a hope to receive a surge in applications in the run up to the general election.

#### GPEW 2023 Spring Conference
Greens of Colour had an active presence at Spring Conference. We held a very popular stall where we launched our Recruitment drive. Local Parties joined the GOC campaign to increase the cultural diversity of their membership by 10 members in 2023. These fantastic local parties have signed up to accept the challenge to recruit a minimum of 10 new cultural diverse members in 2023 - 2024. To show their commitment they each bought 10 GOC badges from our stall: Sandwell, Peterborough, Ealing, North Lancashire, Newham, Sheffield, Isle of Wight, North Hertfordshire and Stevenage, Worcester, Headingley, South Tees, Southwark, Maidstone, Manchester & Hackney.

#### UN 2023 Anti-Racism Day
Greens of Colour Gypsy Roma Traveller Officer, Virgil Bitu, spoke in on Sat 18 Mar in observance of the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in front of BBC in Portland Square, to the restrictions on refugees being increasingly introduced by the UK Government.

### GPEW 2023 Spring PolicyFest

* 17.45 -19.00 Wed 18 Jan Panel discussion on Reparations

### GPEW Rights & Responsibilities Policy Racism section
Greens of Colour have been liaising with GPEW colleagues to help with this update. We provided a definition on racism for the GPRC Equalities, Inclusivity and Equity working Group to consider in their September meeting.

### Elections & Local Parties
Greens of Colour have participated and supported candidates in local elections. Committee members have supported and campaigned with GoC candidates with some committee members also running as candidates themselves. Committee members have also visited Local Parties to engage in conversations about diversification of the party.

Members of the GoC committee have also had success at local elections along with Amanda Onwuemene being appointed as a GPEW spokesperson and Antoinette Fernandez being selected as a candidate in the London Assembly elections.

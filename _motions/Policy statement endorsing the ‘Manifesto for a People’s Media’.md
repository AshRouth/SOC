## Synopsis
Conference endorses the Media Reform Coalition’s ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’ and its vision for a media commons

## Motion
The Media Reform Coalition have produced a ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’, which advocates for the revitalisation of public media through the creation of the media commons. Commons are a collective resource, which are governed jointly by a community. The vision of a media commons presented in the ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’ is an ecology of not-for-profit media initiatives that act in the public interest and have community empowerment at their heart. These organisations would be managed collectively to ensure they practice common values, such as being:

Independent – able to hold powerful interests to account
Accountable – facing consequences when they do harm
Democratic – participatory and representative of diverse lives
For everyone – serving everybody’s needs and accessible to all
The media commons outlined in the ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’ includes a transformed ‘People’s BBC’ and ‘People’s Channel 4’, which have become far more democratic, responsive, and accountable to citizens. It also contains a thriving ecology of independent media producers, supported by new sources of democratically-controlled public funding so they can be present in every community.

Conference notes the strong alignment between the proposals in the ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’ and the principles underpinning the GPEW’s media policies, including that mass media cannot be left solely to the market, and that media and digital communication should be used to facilitate greater public welfare and democracy. The vision of a media commons also reflects central Green principles across its Culture Media and Sport policies of “promoting participation over passive consumption” and “democratising and localising where possible”.

Conference therefore endorses the ‘Manifesto for a People’s Media’ and its vision for a media commons.

## Synopsis
GPEW accepts the damning results of the 25th January 2022 Council of Europe report “Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe”. GPEW accepts that it has been subject to hard-line anti-trans activism for some time; issues cannot be tackled without understanding; and oppression of marginalised groups intersect

## Motion
Insert into Record of Policy Statements: The Green Party recognises the need for civil, open dialogue between party members on the topic of Trans Rights, in order to enable the party to make the most informed policy decisions possible. The Green Party accepts that the “Gender Critical” movements in most UK political parties have been infiltrated by hard-line extremists, who advocate for the wholesale removal of virtually all trans rights as currently enshrined in the Equality Act 2010, and routinely share platforms with those who advocate for extremist positions such as the mass sterilization of trans people. These extremists have also been linked with attacks on women’s abortion rights, misinformation designed to provoke hatred towards trans people, and have benefitted from funding from the far-right. The Green Party condemns hard-line anti-trans activists, including signatories of the “Women’s Declaration International”, which calls for the following:

* A total ban on all trans women from entering any and all women’s spaces, including toilets, changing rooms, etc.
* A ban on all internationally recommended trans healthcare of any kind on under 18s.
* A ban on organisations that recognise Gender Identity (including policy that merely accepts the use of preferred pronouns) from having any involvement in children’s healthcare.
* Legally protect the right to misgender trans women.
* Ban trans women from being legally recognised as mothers, and trans men form being legally recognised as fathers.
* Ban scientific research into fertility treatment for trans women.
* Ban all trans women from misogyny combating measures, such as all women shortlists, scholarships, etc.
* Ban all trans women and girls from women’s sports at all levels of competition, irrespective of the wishes of the organising sporting bodies.
* Ban all trans women from women’s prisons.
* Require all collected statistics to refer to trans women as male, and trans men as female.
* Legally protect parents who seek to deny healthcare or therapy to transgender children. The Green Party recognises that while many moderate gender critical party members may wish to discuss or debate some of the WDI demands, that collectively they represent a hard-line extremist view, involving what would be some of the most extreme anti-trans legislation in any country in Europe. The Green Party expresses regret that the Council of Europe report deems the UK as being on par with Russia, Poland and Hungary when it comes to LGBTI rights, and wishes to oppose any further worsening of our position.

Conference instructs GPEx to provide intersectional equalities and diversity training to elected members, internally and externally, and to local party officers, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the challenges to the rights of all marginalised groups intersect.

Insert into the Code of Conduct: 10.11: Members should under no circumstances sign or have signed public declarations calling for the explicit removal of LGBTQIA+ rights, as enshrined in the Equality Act 2010 (under “gender Identity” and “sexual orientation”), in particular the WHRC declaration/Women’s Declaration International. Those members who do or have done so should be suspended from the party.

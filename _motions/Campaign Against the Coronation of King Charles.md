## Synopsis
This motion seeks to use King Charles IIIâ€™s coronation as a context for campaigning
for the abolition of the monarchy. It also calls for a comms plan for responding to
Royal events in a manner more in keeping with Party policy than has recently been
the case.

## Background

Conference notes the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8th September 2022.

Conference acknowledges the grief of those mourning the loss of Elizabeth
Windsor, particularly her friends, family, and loved ones.

Conference acknowledges the frustrations of those for whom the Queen
represented the oppressive force of British colonialism, and recognises that these
frustrations are being actively prevented from finding expression.

Conference regrets the overly deferential tone of Green Party messaging about the
Queen put out on the Platinum Jubilee and in response to her death. It is
Conference's view that, as a Party seeking to abolish the monarchy, we should be
taking every opportunity to make the case for abolition as per PA600 of PSS:
"PA600 The Green Party believes that the hereditary principle should have no
place in government. Therefore the Green Party advocates that:
a. No person shall acquire the right to any office of government by
inheritance.
b. An hereditary peerage shall confer no right to sit in Parliament (see PA455).
c. The monarchy shall cease to be an office of government. The legislative,
executive and judicial roles of the monarch shall cease.
d. Peers and members of the royal family shall have the same civil rights and
fiscal obligations as other citizens."
Conference notes that the former Prince of Wales has been proclaimed King
Charles III, and that his coronation will occur on Saturday 6th May 2023.

## Motion
Conference instructs GPEx to:
* plan and execute a campaign for the abolition of the monarchy focused on
the Coronation of King Charles III, potentially in partnership with Republic
* develop and bring to Autumn Conference 2023 for approval an external
communications policy for responding to events concerning the King, the
Monarchy, or the Royal Family that:
* avoids showing deference to the monarchy
* uses the situation at hand as a means of promoting GPEW policy on
the monarchy as outlined in PSS
* is binding on all national GPEW external communications
* in partnership with the Association of Green Councillors, develop a model
motion for Local Authorities calling for the abolition of the monarchy, and
pro-actively make it available to all Green Councillors

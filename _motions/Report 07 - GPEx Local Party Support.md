## Motion
General GPEx responsibilities

This year, I have been an active member of GPEx, engaging heavily in discussions and decisions relating to the everyday running of the party, and played a role in helping meetings run more efficiently.
● In a job-share with Jon Nott as Deputy Chair, we have met regularly with the Chair of GPEx to help plan and prepare for each meeting. This has involved advising on how to manage timings, using facilitation techniques to help ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak, and ideas for how to make sure agenda items result in clear actions where necessary.
● I have played an active role as a member of the Elections Steering Committee and the monitoring group of the Political Strategy, and as an observer on some GPEx subcommittees including Development Committee, and AfCom and Safeguarding.
● I have also been active in seeking amendments and improvements to some of the party’s processes and policies including: the annual budget, the screening process of Green Party Spokespeople, clarity over decision-making on our external communications, and very recently, our ethical donations screening policy.
● Lastly, I have made suggestions for how we can move forward following the results of the Diverse Matters report, emphasising that we use the report as a starting point and not as an instruction manual for how we build on our diversity and inclusion in the party. Prior to this and on an ongoing basis, I have pushed for clarity on the progress of a Complaints Process Review, commissioned by GPEx, acknowledging that having a robust complaints system will be core to improving our work on diversity and inclusion.

Local Party Support Coordinator responsibilities
● Generally, I have responded to enquiries from local and regional party officers, attempting to help with their questions on issues such as setting up new bank accounts
● Outside of the busy election period, I have engaged regularly with the staff Field Team, including specifically the Head of Elections and Activism Manager on our support to local parties. This has chiefly involved:
○ Attending several fortnightly field team meetings to keep on top of the team’s priorities and an understanding of the common issues that arise, or good practice that is being developed on the ground in local parties;
○ Discussing a process for reviewing online training resources;
○ Planning a rewrite of the “Party in a Box” resource;
○ Discussions on carrying out a survey or ring rounds to regional and local parties in order to develop a mapping of needs and capacity;
○ Discussions on how we can improve our support to elected councillors as well as candidates, and learn from the work already being carried out via our Climate Action Officer.

## Background

The Party Executive has committed funding to provide support for the Disability Group until the end of 2023. This motion seeks to formalise this position and to extend the arrangement until the end of 2025.

## Synopsis

The Green Party Executive must allocate resources to ensure that the Party’s Disability Group can function adequately. In setting the Party’s budget the Executive must provide the necessary funding through to 2025. The required resources will provide administrative and web support.

## Motion

Conference notes:

The Green Party of England and Wales is committed to equality and inclusion.

For its many disabled members, this inclusion requires that reasonable adjustments be made that will facilitate full participation in all aspects of the life of the Party.

Accordingly, Conference instructs the Green Party Executive to manage the Party’s budget and the priorities of the Party’s staff team in order to provide:

1 Staff resource to create a fully accessible members’ website for the Disability Group, to be accessible to ordinary users and completed by the end of April 2024.

2 Staff resource thereafter to maintain the site, implement updates and improve accessibility over time in line with published best practice (as identified by members of the Disability Group).

3 Staff resource to provide administrative support to officers of the Disability Group.

Conference instructs the Green Party Executive to ensure that such resources are equivalent to at least one full person-day per week for an initial period of three months and equivalent to at least one half person-day per week thereafter until at least the end of 2025.

## Synopsis

\
Recognising the significant impact of our dietary choices on the environment, animal welfare, and public health, the Green Party acknowledges the importance of promoting sustainable and ethical food options. This motion aims to highlight the benefits of vegan biscuits and emphasises the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing sustainability and accessibility in food production.

## Motion

\
Conference resolves to:

1. Promote Vegan Biscuits:\
   a. Recognise the potential of vegan biscuits as a sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional biscuits made with animal-derived ingredients.\
   b. Encourage individuals, businesses, schools, and other institutions to incorporate vegan biscuits into their menus and offerings, making them more widely accessible to the general public.
2. Harness AI for Sustainable Food Production:\
   a. Recognise the potential of AI in optimising food production processes, including ingredient sourcing, recipe development, and packaging, to reduce waste and improve efficiency.\
   b. Advocate for research and development in AI technologies for sustainable agriculture, such as precision farming, resource optimisation, and crop yield improvement, to support the production of plant-based ingredients used in vegan biscuits.
3. Raise Awareness:\
   a. Launch educational campaigns and initiatives to raise awareness about the environmental and animal welfare implications of animal-based ingredients in biscuits.\
   b. Provide information on the benefits of vegan biscuits, including their reduced carbon footprint, conservation of water resources, and the ethical treatment of animals, as well as the potential of AI in advancing sustainability in food production.
4. Support Local and Small-Scale Producers:\
   a. Advocate for government support, grants, and incentives for local and small-scale producers of vegan biscuits to encourage their growth and market accessibility.\
   b. Collaborate with relevant agricultural and food agencies to provide technical assistance, training, and resources to assist local producers in adopting AI technologies for sustainable food production.
5. Engage in Research and Development:\
   a. Encourage investment in research and development of innovative plant-based ingredients and production techniques for vegan biscuits, leveraging AI to optimise formulation and production processes.\
   b. Support academic institutions and food research centres in conducting studies on the environmental, health, and socioeconomic benefits of vegan biscuits and the integration of AI in sustainable food production.
6. Legislative Support:\
   a. Advocate for the inclusion of vegan biscuits in public procurement policies and school meal programmes to provide healthier and more sustainable food options.\
   b. Collaborate with policymakers to explore incentives and tax breaks for companies producing vegan biscuits and leveraging AI technologies for sustainable food production.
7. Collaboration with NGOs and Activist Groups:\
   a. Partner with animal welfare organisations, environmental NGOs, and community-based activist groups to promote the benefits of vegan biscuits and the role of AI in advancing sustainability in food production.\
   b. Work together to address any barriers or challenges faced by vegan biscuit producers and encourage the adoption of AI technologies where feasible.

Conclusion: By adopting this motion, the Party will demonstrate its commitment to promoting sustainable and ethical food choices. Embracing vegan biscuits as a viable alternative to traditional biscuits, while harnessing the potential of AI in sustainable food production, will contribute to a more environmentally friendly, compassionate, and technologically advanced society.

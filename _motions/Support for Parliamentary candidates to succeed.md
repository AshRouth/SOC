## Synopsis
To set out a longstanding expectation that requires Green Party staff to provide media training for Parliamentary candidates and help Local Parties to ensure Parliamentary candidates positively promote Green Party policy across all media platforms.

## Motion
For the GPEX Elections Co-ordinator to ensure that:

* Green Party staff provide training on hustings, social media and comms
* Green Party staff provide tools and resources that help parliamentary candidates support the Green Party of England and Walesâ€™ policies, aims and objectives and to model party values of democracy and inclusivity

To insert into the by-laws the following:

* Green Party staff provide a standard candidate agreement which all Local Parties will use as part of their candidate selection process. This will include expectation on the approach by parliamentary candidates to media performances (including print, broadcast and on all online platforms), which should positively promote Green Party policy and values

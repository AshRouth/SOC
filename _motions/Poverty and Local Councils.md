## Synopsis
This motion is to act as guidance to local Green Councillors and local parties on the massive impact of trying to collect Council Tax from people in poverty or being forced into poverty due to the cost of living Crisis.

## Motion
Millions of people including children are increasingly being forced into poverty. Greens are proud that we are the party that has consistently campaigned against austerity, low pay, cuts to benefits and poverty including fuel poverty.

Greens have also been at the forefront to mitigate punitive action against the poorest in society. The inability to pay Council Tax is a major concern given that cruel resulting actions (with resulting increasing debt) may be taken against those who cannot afford to pay.

Therefore, GPEW conference believes that enforcement action regarding unpaid Council Tax including Benefit Deductions and Bailiff Action should be suspended by local councils and instead transfer resources to the real need to maximise benefit take up and maximise grants available for the large number of people facing increased poverty especially fuel poverty.

This conference would urge Green Councillors and local parties to raise this suggested mitigating action in their local authority.

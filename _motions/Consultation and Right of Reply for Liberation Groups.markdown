## Synopsis

Too frequently there are motions submitted which clearly affect members of liberation groups, but have not consulted those groups. This motion seeks to find options to ensure proper consultation and rights of reply where appropriate.

## Motion

Insert into Record of Organisational Statements:

"Conference instructs Policy Development Committee to convene a working group (membership to be determined by the Policy Development Coordinator and must include at least one member of Standing Orders Committee) to discuss and debate possible options for ensuring that Members Working Groups which are recognised by the Equality and Diversity Committee are adequately consulted and have a right of reply to any proposed policy which is targeted at members of such a group. Thereafter this group will run a workshop at either Autumn Conference 2022, or any EGM held between Autumn Conference 2022 and Spring Conference 2023, to discuss and debate options, and will present a voting paper at the following conference to be voted upon.

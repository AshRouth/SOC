## Synopsis
Suspend trade agreement with Faroe Islands until all whale & dolphin hunts end

## Motion
Insert into Record of policy statements:

In 2019 UK Government finalised a free trade agreement (FTA) with Faroe Islands which allows for Â£100 million of exports of wild caught and farmed fish to Britain per annum (20% of the Faroe Islands global trade). This FTA should be suspended until all whale & dolphin hunts on Faroe Islands end

The Free Trade Agreement with the Faroe Islands gives the UK Government significant leverage when it comes to ending the mass slaughter of pilot whales and dolphins on the Faroe Islands which causes huge anger and revulsion around the world. If the UK is to be considered a world leader in the protection of marine mammals it must use this leverage now

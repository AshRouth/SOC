## Synopsis

PDC to establish a working group to review the Green Party Tourism policies, last reviewed in 2009 with a particular remit to develop and incorporate Heritage policies to incorporate in this section of the PfSS.

## Motion

The Green Party Tourism Policy in Policies for a Sustainable Society (PfSS) was last reviewed in 2009, and has had no amendments since 2014. The policies need to be reviewed to take account of changes in the world since then. The Green Party does not have a Heritage Policy, and an enabling motion to agree one expired.

Conference instructs Policy Development Committee (PDC) to initiate a policy development process to:

a)       Review the section of PfSS relating to Tourism, currently entitled ‘Tourism’

b)      Establish a Green Party Heritage Policy as a component of that section of PfSS

The process will be undertaken by a policy working group (PWG), which should seek the involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in these fields, as well as Green Parties in Scotland. Ireland and elsewhere in the world, including the global south. The PWG will also consult relevant NGOs and professionals.

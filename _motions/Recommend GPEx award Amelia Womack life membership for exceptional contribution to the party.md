## Background
This motion is necessary as a vote has inexplicably not been called on this following official recommendations to the chair of GPEx from members and from GPEx members, as is the usual process.

It would be better that a vote is held before conference, respecting the proper process, and this motion would then not be necessary.

The process is outlined as:

“Life membership can be awarded to members for exceptional contribution to the party, to be voted on by GPEx following a recommendation sent by any member or committee within the party.”

This process was agreed at Spring 2017 conference.

## Synopsis
Spring conference 2017 granted GPEx the power to award members with a life membership of the party in recognition of an ‘exceptional contribution’ to the party. This motion recommends that GPEx award a life membership to Amelia Womack.

## Motion
Conference notes the exceptional contribution by Amelia Womack in her 8 years as Deputy Leader of the party:

Amelia has led the party through 3 General Elections, 2 Wales Elections, 2 London elections, and countless Local Elections campaigns. She has represented the party in election debates and in countless TV and radio interviews. She has been a strong and vocal supporter of internal learning on issues from antisemitism to the rights of GRT communities. She has led numerous election campaigns as a target candidate. She has recruited countless members, and activated and inspired countless more, into positions of leadership and elected office themselves. She has led the national conversation on domestic violence through incredibly bravery about her own experience. She travelled to support local parties at the drop of a hat, from Newport to Newham and from Burnley to Bristol, and more. There probably isn’t an active local party in this country that doesn’t owe part of their energy to events with Amelia. She has taken a lead on national organisations including Another Europe is Possible and People's Assembly. The Young Greens have received incredibly levels of support from her. She has stepped away when few doubt she could continue to hold the role she does, to enable a new generation of leaders. She is endlessly kind and generous, and there isn’t a campaign for justice she wouldn’t throw her all into. She endlessly amplifies those who need the platform she has. She has served in our leadership team for more than half of the time the role has even existed, and is the longest consecutive member of the team. She is a fierce fighter for social and environmental justice.

Conference commends Amelia Womack for her fantastic service to the Green Party and wishes her well for the future.

Conference recommends that the Green Party Executive Committee awards Amelia Womack life membership in recognition of her exceptional contribution to the party.

Conference instructs the Chair of GPEx to call a vote of GPEx on granting Amelia Womack life membership by the GPEx meeting immediately following conference.

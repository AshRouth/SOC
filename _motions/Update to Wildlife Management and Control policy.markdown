## Synopsis
Proposal to update AR423 ‘Wildlife management and control’ to ensure the that regardless of setting and species, wild population control should be planned and carried out with regard to the welfare of animals and impact on the environment.
The GPEW Animal Rights PWG plans to update our current Wildlife Control [Note from SOC - Synopsis word limit reached]

## Motion

Proposed new wording for AR423:

AR423 Wildlife management and control: in harmony with WH210 elected Greens will seek to redefine ‘pest and vermin control’ as ‘wildlife management and control’ and acknowledge the suffering of wild animals subjected to such control to be as significant as animals in other circumstances. A Green Government will implement a wildlife management and control protocol that would ensure:

(1)there is justification for control,

(2) non-lethal strategies such as proofing and prevention have been considered as a first resort

(3)there is reasonable probability of success,

(4)there is an integrated and strategic approach

(5)there is target-specificity,

(6)humaneness, and

(7) consistency with the preservation of natural ecosystems.

For reference: The Wildlife and Habitats policy; WH210 Proposals for culling will only be considered if all non-lethal strategies have failed. Rigorous scientific assessment of all possible options will be required to take full account of wider impacts on habitats and species. In the case of the real, alleged or projected spread of disease this would include evaluation of mass vaccination schemes

Current AR423:

AR423 Wildlife management and control in urban and domestic settings (vertebrate species). Elected Greens will seek to redefine ‘pest control’ as ‘wildlife management and control’ and acknowledge the suffering of wild animals subjected to such control to be as significant as animals in other circumstances. A Green Government will implement a wildlife management and control protocol that would ensure: (1) there is justification for control, (2) proofing and prevention has been considered as a first resort,(3) there is reasonable probability of success, (4) there is an integrated and strategic approach, (5) there is target-specificity and (6) humaneness.

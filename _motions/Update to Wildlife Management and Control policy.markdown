Motion


Update current policy AR423 “Wildlife management and control.”


The GPEW Animal Rights PWG plans to update our current Wildlife Control policy AR423.


The reworded policy aims to implement, with some adaptation, the International Consensus Principles for Ethical Wildlife Control (Dubois et al., 2017) to bring the Green Party in line with the RSPB among others.


The update removes restrictions and expands the policy to all settings, not just domestic and urban, and all animals not just vertebrate species as it is now.


We specifically cross-reference to the Wildlife and Habitats culling policy (WH210) as we believe it is in harmony with our policy.


We have inserted the words “and vermin” because as soon as a group of animals are talked of and thought of as “vermin” there is less kindness and more hostility when dealing with them – we would like animals labelled “vermin” to be protected by the policy (whichever animals they happen to be at the time).


We call for non-lethal strategies to be considered first, and only ruled out if there is evidence that they would be ineffective or impractical, congruent with the W&H policy.


We add a final new clause that natural ecosystems should be preserved and finally, add the relevant reference.


Proposed new wording for AR423:


AR423 Wildlife management and control: in harmony with WH210 elected Greens willseek to redefine ‘pest and vermin control’ as ‘wildlife management and control’and acknowledge the suffering of wild animals subjected to such control to beas significant as animals in other circumstances. A Green Government willimplement a wildlife management and control protocol that would ensure:


(1)there is justification for control,


(2) non-lethal strategies such as proofing and prevention have beenconsidered as a first resort


(3)there is reasonable probability of success,


(4)there is an integrated and strategic approach


(5)there is target-specificity,


(6)humaneness, and


(7) consistency with the preservation of natural ecosystems.


For reference: The Wildlife and Habitats policy; WH210 Proposals for culling will only be considered if all non-lethal strategies have failed. Rigorous scientific assessment of all possible options will be required to take full account of wider impacts on habitats and species. In the case of the real, alleged or projected spread of disease this would include evaluation of mass vaccination schemes


Current AR423:


AR423 Wildlife management and control in urban and domestic settings (vertebrate species). Elected Greens will seek to redefine ‘pest control’ as ‘wildlife management and control’ and acknowledge the suffering of wild animals subjected to such control to be as significant as animals in other circumstances. A Green Government will implement a wildlife management and control protocol that would ensure: (1) there is justification for control, (2) proofing and prevention has been considered as a first resort,(3) there is reasonable probability of success, (4) there is an integrated and strategic approach, (5) there is target-specificity and (6) humaneness.

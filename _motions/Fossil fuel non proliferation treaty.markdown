## Synopsis

Following COP26 it’s become clearer than ever that we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground, and that the UK needs to take a lead. The Fossil Fuel Non Proliferation Treaty is a practical multilateral process, already supported by campaigners across the world, which seeks to achieve that.

## Motion

Conference:

Notes that to limit global heating to below 1.5°C, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by at least 6% per year between 2020 and 2030 – and to complement measures to reduce emissions and the demand for fossil fuels with measures to reduce their production and supply.

Calls on the UK Government and Welsh Senedd to publicly endorse the need for a Fossil Fuel Non Proliferation Treaty (FFNPT); to  seek international agreement for a treaty to phase out fossil fuel production; and to bring forward comprehensive domestic fossil fuel regulation for a fast and fair transition.

Instructs the campaigns and external communications coordinators to prioritise promotion of a FFNPT in the Party’s work tackling the climate emergency.

Urges local and regional parties to campaign in support of a FFNPT and councillors to bring forward supportive local authority motions.

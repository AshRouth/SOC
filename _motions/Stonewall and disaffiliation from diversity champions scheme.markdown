Synopsis


Conference instructs GPEX to disaffiliate from the Diversity Champions Scheme from next financial year on grounds of value for money, reputational risk management and sound interpretation of the Equality Act 2010.


Motion


Insert into Record of Organisational Statements:


Conference recognises the extraordinary role played by Stonewall, since its inception in 1989, in spearheading LGBTIQ+ campaigns. Lately, however, public organisations and bodies, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, have found reasons to disaffiliate from their Diversity Champions Scheme. Principally, justified criticism has been made of Stonewall's interpretation of the Equality Act 2010 - in promoting misinterpretations of the Act as how they would like it to be not how it is.


The Green Party needs to be able to ensure sound interpretation and application of the Equality Act in its internal governance and campaigning work. Conference is not satisfied that our rolling annual Â£2,500 subscription to the Scheme represents value for money going forward. Nor is our continued subscription consistent with good reputational risk management and sound interpretation of the Equality Act.


Conference instructs GPEX to disaffiliate from the Diversity Champions Scheme from the next financial year.

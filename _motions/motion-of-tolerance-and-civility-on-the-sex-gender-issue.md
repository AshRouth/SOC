## S﻿ynopsis

This motion calls on Green Party members to treat each other with tolerance and civility - particularly those with a different opinion to theirs on issues relating to sex and gender.

## Motion


The Green Party should be a welcoming and safe place for all, including women, trans and non-binary people. It should also be a safe place for those with a variety of opinions on issues relating to sex and gender. The Green Party Code of Conduct (12.1) states "As the Green Party welcomes people from a wide range of backgrounds, members may encounter people who hold differing political or philosophical worldviews. Freedom of belief and the right to change that belief is a fundamental human right. Members should therefore show tolerance and respect towards people that hold political or philosophical worldviews that differ from their own."

On the issue of sex and gender, the party includes people with so-called gender-critical views and others who oppose such views. It is now established in law that gender-critical views are covered by the protected characteristic of Religion and Belief under the Equality Act (2010). It is assumed that views opposing gender-critical views would also be protected as a philosophical belief. The Green Party code of conduct states  “11.3 Members must not behave in a discriminatory manner towards someone on the basis of any protected characteristic that person may have.”

Therefore both sides on this topic have the right to hold their opinions, express those opinions and to do so without intimidation or harassment as long as they don't intimidate or harass others. Conference urges all members and staff to treat each other with tolerance and civility, particularly those with a different opinion to theirs on issues relating to sex and gender.

Conference therefore:

(1) Instructs Internal Comms to inform all local parties and the CEO to inform all GPEW staff of this motion

(2) Asks GPEx, GPRC and all the party's national bodies to operate in a way which respects the principles of the motion and in particular to have regard to legal guidance on respecting different protected philosophical beliefs

(3) Requests that the Code of Conduct Oversight Body amends the Green Party Code of Conduct by adding to clause 11.3 the text “ This includes beliefs that meet the required criteria to be a protected characteristic under the 2010 Equality Act.” So clause 11.3 will now read:

*11.3 Members must not behave in a discriminatory manner towards someone on the basis of any protected characteristic that person may have. This includes beliefs that meet the required criteria to be a protected characteristic under the 2010 Equality Act.*

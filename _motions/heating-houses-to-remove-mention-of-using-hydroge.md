## **Synopsis**

Supplies of green hydrogen will remain limited within our ten year planning period and hydrogen is an inefficient heating method. Therefore we should not use it to heat buildings and should prioritise its other uses.

## **Motion**

**EN016** reads:

“Hydrogen will be produced from excess renewable electricity generation by electrolysis. The Green Hydrogen produced – along with synthetic fuels derived from it – will have a role in electricity generation (EN010), heating homes (EN021), industry (EN030) and transport (EN041). Production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will be phased out.

Delete words “heating homes (EN021),”

So that it reads:

“Hydrogen will be produced from excess renewable electricity generation by electrolysis. The Green Hydrogen produced – along with synthetic fuels derived from it – will have a role in electricity generation (EN010), industry (EN030) and transport (EN041). Production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will be phased out.

**EN021** reads:

EN021 Heating of buildings will be transformed by the use of solar thermal, heat pumps, biofuels, stored heat, hydrogen and relevant derived synthetic fuels, electricity and geothermal. The use of natural gas for heating will be phased out entirely.

Delete words “hydrogen and relevant derived synthetic fuels,”

So that it reads:

EN021 Heating of buildings will be transformed by the use of solar thermal, heat pumps, biofuels, stored heat, electricity and geothermal. The use of natural gas for heating will be phased out entirely.

**EN022** reads:

EN022 New buildings will be built to energy efficient very low carbon standards.

Delete “energy efficient very low carbon standards.” and substitute “be energy efficient and to have low embodied carbon. This will be achieved through the Planning system (see paras LP151, 152, 413 and 414).”

So that it reads:

EN022 New buildings will be built to be energy efficient and to have low embodied carbon. This will be achieved through the Planning system (see paras LP151, 152, 413 and 414).

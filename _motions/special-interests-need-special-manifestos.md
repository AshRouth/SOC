## **Synopsis**

Typically, our party publishes manifestos from our special interest groups at election time. However, the process at the last General Election was vague - with shifting timelines and goalposts. This motion seeks to formalise a process making manifestos for Special Interest Groups mandatory.

## **Motion**

Insert a new 13 vii into the Green Party Constitution and renumber

vii. The party shall also publish community and issue specific manifestos at a General Election, developed with our special interest groups and support given to them from the Equality and Diversity Coordinator on the Green Party Executive. These will include:

·       A LGBTIQA+ Greens manifesto (produced by LGBTIQA+ Greens)

·       A Greens of Colour manifesto (produced by Greens of Colour)

·       A Green Women manifesto (produced by Green Party Women)

·       A Young Greens manifesto (produced by Young Greens)

·       A Jewish Greens manifesto (produced by Jewish Greens)

·       A Disability manifesto (produced by the Green Party Disability Group)

·       An Animal Protection manifesto (produced by Greens for Animal Protection)

At the start of the election GPRC will be mandated to provide a clear timeline for approval and publication.

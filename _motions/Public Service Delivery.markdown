## Synopsis

As the Government continues cutting funding they are relying on volunteers to keep our libraries; parks; schools; youth and health services; and other public services running. As well as depriving people of jobs, this undervalues the skills of public sector staff and undermines the service received by the public.

## Motion

Insert new EC685 The Green Party welcomes the involvement of communities in decisions about how public services are run and we value the work of volunteers in helping to provide a wider range of services. However, volunteers should never be used as a replacement for properly qualified staff. The management plan for public services should always be based on them being run by paid staff, not relying on volunteers to keep core services running. A Green Government would ensure public services are properly funded to enable this to happen. Where volunteers are used to deliver core services, they should be properly trained to do so and only used on a temporary basis until vacancies are filled by a member of staff.

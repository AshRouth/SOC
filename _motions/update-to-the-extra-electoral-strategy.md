## Synopsis

Rewrite, renumbering and update of the Extra-Electoral Strategy drawn up in 1995.  This is to provide a clearer and more up-to-date remit for the Party’s Campaigns Committee.



## Motion



Conference notes that the Green Party’s constitution defines the role of the Campaigns Committee by reference to the Extra-Electoral Strategy of 1995 and that the Party’s Extra- Electoral Strategy has not been updated for nearly 30 years and is no longer fit for purpose. To address this and to define a clearer remit for Campaigns Committee it accepts the following  revision of the Extra-Electoral Strategy.



### In the Extra-Electoral Strategy Voting Paper as passed by Autumn Conf 1995.

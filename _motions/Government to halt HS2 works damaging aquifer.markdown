## Synopsis

Green Party calls for a halt to HS2 works in the Mid Chilterns Chalk aquifer, until HS2 can demonstrate that groundwater resources, providing significant quantities of Public Drinking Water, can be protected throughout construction and operation of the railway, in line with UK regulations.

## Motion

In September 2021 HS2 Ltd confirmed building additional purification works at Public Water pumping stations across the Colne Valley and closing the main water supply station in Harefield, Hillingdon. This is against UK water regulations which are in place to prevent activities that could lead to additional purification treatment.

Conference affirms that:

i)                    Nothing is more important to public health or the economy, than good quality sustainable drinking water.

ii)                   Under the timescale agreed by the UK with the EU, it is not been possible for the UK to deteriorate raw drinking water resources, even for a short period of time. The time for the UK to grant exemptions, to strict water quality protection, ran out in 2012.

iii)                 The HS2 Act (2017) does not disapply any water protection legislation.

iv)                 In parts of Affinity Water Ltd Central Region, the public are drinking water that has travelled much further distances and has undergone further purification treatments.

v)                  The eastern leg of HS2 was cancelled in November 2021 due to spiralling costs. Costs to mitigate for HS2 works in the aquifer are also rising, with a possibility of irreparable damage being done. It is now time for damage limitation.

Therefore, Conference calls upon the Government to halt works in the Mid Chilterns Chalk aquifer until HS2 can show that all risks to groundwater have been assessed, mitigated and that raw water quality can be protected throughout construction and operation of the railway line.

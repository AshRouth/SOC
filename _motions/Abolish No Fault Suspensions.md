## Motion
Our complaints process is not fit for purpose. It costs the Party dearly in terms of finance, human resources, the wellbeing and reputation of members and the organisation itself. Despite an enormous amount of time and effort by members from GPRC, Disciplinary Committee and elsewhere, to reform and fix the process, it remains a hugely damaging and traumatic experience for its participants.

I have proposals for a couple of major reforms which I believe would provide substantial improvements to the current system. I will post these elsewhere later if time permits. This post concerns solely to one particularly diabolical aspect of the process, that of “No-Fault Suspensions”.

On the Party’s official complaint form, the complainant is asked to state whether they want the subject of their complaint (known as the respondent) to be placed under an immediate No-Fault Suspension. If a complaint is received with such a request, it is quickly despatched to both:

1.   the complaints referral group, to determine whether the complaint should be dismissed, referred to Disciplinary Committee or another body

2.   GPRC – to decide whether it poses an immediate risk to the Party, or to bodies or individuals. If yes, an immediate GPRC  Temporary No Fault Suspension is placed on the respondent.

A group of 5 GPRC members (“the GPRC on-calls) are the first to examine the complaint and impose a No Fault Suspension if they think it’s appropriate. Having seen full details of many complaints that have earned suspensions I regret to say the bar is set extremely low. The respondent is not allowed to respond and put their case, nor is any appeal permitted.

At the next GPRC meeting, which could be up to three months away, the on-calls’ decision is ratified by the whole committee, who are provided with scant information about the complaint on which to make their decision.

GPRC members consider whether to continue or end the temporary suspension at their quarterly meetings, until the complaint has been dealt with by the Disciplinary Committee. It is confidential closed session – no observer -  I have never known them to lift a suspension. Several members have been left on No Fault Suspensions for well over a year.

During this time, they cannot undertake any voluntary activity on behalf of local, regional or national party.  They must hand over any admin logins to official social media channels they control (eg local Party Twitter), and are not be permitted to attend Conference or any local or regional events. They cannot stand in local elections.

All these draconian sanctions are imposed on the basis on a complaint made, often by an anonymous member, by GPRC members who have very limited knowledge of the case, all of which is provided by the complainant. This is pure Kafkaesque.  An appalling way to treat out members, who frequently suffer depression and develop feelings of resentment and betrayal towards the Party that they may have spent years loyally serving.

Ironically, far more harm is likely to result from imposing No Fault Suspension, to the individual and the Party. Harm to their reputation, especially if they are elected local councillors. Disruption to their local parties, national or region committees they are members of – even members of GPEx have been subject to this process. None of the time served on a No Fault Suspension is taken into account after the fact.

No Fault Suspensions are probably illegal – they have already caused huge damage to individual members and significant financial cost to the Party.

And they are totally unnecessary. GPRC already have the power to suspend seriously problematic people without this sanction.

I am going to propose that No Fault Suspension are removed from our complaints process altogether.

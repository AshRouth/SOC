Synopsis


We need to update our existing Health policy to reflect our opposition to the 2022 Health and Care Act and to escalating privatisation of health and social care provision in England and Wales.


Motion


In HE105, delete all after “will repeal the” and insert “the Health and Care Act 2022 in its entirety and the remaining provisions of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.” HE105 would then read:


“HE105 The Green Party will repeal the Health and Care Act 2022 in its entirety and the remaining provisions of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.”
Add new HE106:


“HE106 The Green Party will legislate to guarantee health rights previously covered by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, notably the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment.”
Add new HE1305, as follows:


“HE1305 The NHS and all policies linked to health care and the pricing of medicines will be explicitly excluded from all international trade agreements.”
Add new HE1504, as follows:


“HE1504 Measures will be introduced to protect whistle-blowers in order that speaking out is safeguarded, not least when workers alert the media and others to areas of concern in the NHS.”

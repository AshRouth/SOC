Motion


Conference notes that the recent Health and Social Care Act poses serious threats to the NHS; that the NHS is already facing one of the worst crises in its history and that, in the last five years alone, private companies were handed £15 billion worth of NHS contracts.


Resolves to strengthen GPEW Health policies on reversing fragmentation of the NHS, ending the internal market and opposing the use of underfunding to open doors to greater privatisation and to damage pay and conditions of the workforce.


Conference reconfirms the party's commitment to campaign to restore the NHS fully and asks the Green Party Executive to campaign for adequate protection of staff terms and conditions, in particular collective bargaining and union rights, and to  promote the party’s opposition to the 2021/22 Health & Social Care Act, in particular the transfer of resources away from the public health system, damage to service levels and the threats it poses to the pay and conditions of the workforce.

## Motion
Revise and update the policies EU 900-908 as follows.

Delete existing text entirely, EU 900-906 including associated headings:
Part 8: UK Membership of the EU

EU900 The Green Party supports European co-operation on Green lines, as set out in our Vision for Europe (see Part 1). However, the EU is founded on a commitment to economic growth which cannot be sustained.

EU901 While much good has come out of the European Union there remain many policies that urgently need changing, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. Future developments in the EU must take the EU closer towards Green principles and objectives.

EU902 The Green Party's aim is a reconstitution of the EU as a European Confederation of Regions on Green lines pursuing ecological policies.

EU903 Whilst the Green Party is opposed to the objectives, structure and policies of the EU as currently constituted, as long as the U.K. remains a member of the EU the Green Party will stand in elections to the European Parliament and elected Green MEPs will work for fundamental reform of the EU from within.

EU904 So long as the UK remains a member of the EU, The Green Party will campaign and support negotiations to achieve any improvements in the EU which are possible.

EU905 Any UK decision to withdraw from the EU shall be subject to a referendum.

Part 9: Britain's Exit from the EU/"Brexit"

Background:

EU906: On June 23rd, 2016 the UK voted by a slim majority to leave the European Union. Despite the Prime Minister’s talk of aiming to bring the country together, she has outlined a vision of Brexit that will very likely see inequality in Britain significantly worsen as we are forced to become a corporate tax haven to attract and keep investment from big business and as spending for vital public services such as the NHS is therefore eroded yet further. We reject this vision, in which workers’ and consumers’ rights are also no longer guaranteed, and will campaign strongly during negotiations with the EU for as close a relationship as possible, with particular focus on four key issues which represent priorities for the Party:

i) Maintaining environmental regulation at least as strong as current EU regulation including the passage of an Environment Act/Environmental Protection Act with its own court of arbitration;

ii) Preventing a race to the bottom on tax and ensuring Brexit is not used as an opportunity to turn the UK into a tax haven;

iii) Defending, and advocating Green-minded reforms of, the single market as currently the best means to free movement, migrants rights and a future of bridges not walls, and in particular of protecting the existing reciprocal rights enjoyed by EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in other parts of the EU.

iv) Ensuring that young people have rights to work, travel, and study equal at least to those they enjoy now.

Replace with the following new text (EU 900-908)

EU 900: The Green Party regrets that the UK is no longer a member of the European Union. We continue to believe that the UK would be in a better position socially, environmentally and economically if we had maintained our EU membership. ​​We recognise that a united international response to global issues is even more needed in the contemporary world.

EU 901: The Green Party maintains that full membership of the EU remains the best option for the UK, and we are in favour of pursuing a policy to re-join as soon as the political situation is favourable and the right terms are available.

EU 902: We deplore the UK government’s failure to prepare properly for the massive changes to our economic and social structures caused by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, putting businesses at risk and damaging citizens’ opportunities. We also regret the decision not to undertake any official monitoring of the economic impacts of leaving the EU.

EU 903: We believe that many of the worst problems resulting from Brexit would be eased by re-joining the customs union and signing up to a comprehensive agreement with the EU covering the protection of human, animal and plant life. We would also support a speedy return to free movement of people between the UK and the European Union, and an urgent restoration of our inclusion in the Horizon Europe Research programme.

EU 904: While we continue to support the principle of subsidiarity, local supply chains, and strengthened local economies, the Green Party believes that the UK should mirror or improve on the legislative rules governing the EU single market and its standards on workers’ rights, health and safety, and environmental protection.

EU 905: In particular, we deeply regret the loss of rights and opportunities afforded to our young people and will campaign to ensure that all young people regardless of background and socio-economic status, continue to enjoy the opportunity to explore the continent they share with those from the 27 EU member states, particularly through continued participation in the Erasmus+ scheme.

{% include amendment.html number="3" %}

EU 906: The Green Party of England and Wales deplores the use of the UK Internal Market Act to limit the rights of the devolved nations to retain their alignment with the EU, and to go further and faster with environmental protection measures. We are deeply concerned that peace in Northern Ireland is threatened as a result of the UK government’s attempts to undo the Northern Ireland protocol.

EU 907: For as long as the UK remains outside the EU we support close political cooperation with the EU, and in particular working with the EU in addressing the twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss. We encourage close cooperation with the EU in support of European and global peace and security.

EU 908: We commit to maintaining or rebuilding close and friendly relationships with our European neighbours through groups such as pro-European organisations, professional associations and twinning schemes

Amend existing text EU 907 and associated heading, and delete existing EU 908 as follows:

Short term policies:

EU907: The EU referendum campaign exposed deep divisions in our society and highlighted the growing inequality in our country. We reject the idea that membership of the EU is to blame for these problems and reaffirm our commitment to policies that are designed to share wealth and opportunities more equally and fairly. The Green Party will work with others to heal our divided communities because genuine democracy requires a shared vision of the future we can build together. We want to share our radical policies on farming, food and the countryside, and on trade and globalisation as part of this debate.

EU908: Furthermore, we believe that democracy requires Parliament has ample opportunity to scrutinise the terms of the Brexit deal that emerges from negotiations, and the country be given a further say by way of a ratification referendum on the proposed deal.

Replace with the following amended text

EU909: The EU referendum campaign exposed severe inadequacies in our democratic safeguards, and uncovered  deep divisions in our society. It  highlighted the growing inequality in our country and widespread unhappiness about the way that the country was being run. We reject the idea that these problems were due to the UK’s membership of the EU and reaffirm our commitment to policies that are designed to share wealth and opportunities more equally and fairly. The Green Party will work with others to heal our divided communities because genuine democracy requires a shared vision of the future we can build together.

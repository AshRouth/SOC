## Synopsis

The rise of AI is transforming many industries. AI is now used in public domain and corporate sectors and concerns exist at individual, national and international levels. However, the potential for benefit from AI is enormous, encompassing most areas of society so good governance rather than prevention is our aim.

## Motion 

We move that the Green Party adopt policy outlining core ideas on AI and addressing specific concerns but also encouraging beneficial AI usage in ways that are safe, transparent, ethical and eco-friendly through regulation and guidelines.

(Preliminary discussions on this have happened within Digital, Cutural, Media and Sport PWG).

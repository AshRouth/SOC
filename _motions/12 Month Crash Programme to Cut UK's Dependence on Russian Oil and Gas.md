## Synopsis
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is funded by sales of coal, oil and gas making
buying these fuels both morally abhorrent and self-defeating. This motion demands an
emergency programme to reduce our use of oil and gas and to help the rest of Europe do
the same.

## Motion

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created a perfect storm in the energy market and
exacerbated the cost of living crisis in the UK. The Green Party demands an emergency
programme for energy-saving to end UK funding of Putin’s war and to assist the rest of
Western Europe in making the same change.

We can, and should, reduce the UK’s use of oil and gas by more than our imports from
Russia within one year. The Green Party calls upon the government to invest an extra £11
billion in the next 12 months:
* an extra £5 billion in retrofitting buildings with wall and loft insulation and £2 billion
on heat pumps.
* £4 billion in renewable energy projects.

In addition we demand that the government makes the case, as acts of solidarity with Ukraine, for people to reduce their personal energy use. We should target delivery of a 20% reduction by:

* Driving less,
* Flying less (or not at all)
* Heating buildings less.

The government should also reduce road speed limits, as was done during the 1973 oil crisis (and to match many other countries’ actions).

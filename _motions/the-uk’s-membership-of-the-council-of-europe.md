## Synopsis

The Europe Policy Working Group proposes to insert into the Europe Chapter an affirmation of the importance of continued membership of the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights.

## Motion:

To insert into Policies for a Sustainable Society the following new section:

### Part 10: The Council of Europe

EU1000 The Council of Europe has an essential role in support of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The UK should be a committed and active member.

### The Council of Europe

EU1010 The Green Party of England and Wales will ensure that the UK remains an active and committed member of the Council of Europe, which through its Conventions, its committees, and its facilitation of parliamentary and NGO exchanges plays a vital role in strengthening respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law across Europe. We will work to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of Europe and its institutions, as a foundation of a fairer society throughout Europe on the basis of common values. We will support the continued development of the Conventions to ensure that they remain relevant in a changing world.

EU1011 The Green Party is fully committed to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the cornerstone of the work of the Council of Europe, and provides protection for fundamental rights and freedoms across Europe. See RR400-402 for the party’s policy on access to Convention rights in the domestic courts.

EU1012 The Green Party supports early completion of negotiations for the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights.

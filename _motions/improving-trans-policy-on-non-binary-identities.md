## Synopsis

Currently our transgender policy categorises non-binary identities differently to other genders, which non-binary people can find othering, this motion seeks to update the language to be more inclusive.

## Motion

Current text:

RR530 The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people’s identities as real. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

Delete "that non-binary identities exist and are valid"

And replace with "non-binary people are non-binary"

So it reads as:

RR530 The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that trans men are men, trans women are women, and non-binary people are non-binary. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people’s identities as real. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

Since the election of the LGBTIQA+ Greens committee in December 2022, we have been working hard to represent members of diverse sex, gender and sexuality. The committee is currently comprised of:

* Cade Hatton – Co-Chair
* Dylan Lewis-Creser – Co-Chair
* Ria Patel – Liberation Officer
* Norm Cassidy – Treasurer
* Mina Cousins – External Communications Officer
* Marz King – Membership Secretary
* Olli Watkins – Co-Secretary
* Jack Blomfield – Co-Secretary
* Rob Callender – Digital Communications Officer
* Matt Rogan – Policy Officer
* Thomas Atkin – International Officer
* Josh Harris – Campaigns Officer

Our three campaigns this year have been on an Inclusive Conversion Therapy Ban, supporting LGBTIQA+ refugees, and ending new HIV Transmissions by 2030. We contributed significantly to the motion passed at Spring Conference 2023, called ‘Ending New HIV Transmissions by 2030 Part 2’, alongside ‘Access to Fertility Treatment’. These motions strengthened our policy position on issues that affect our members, and we are proud of this.

We have also run a letter-writing campaign on an Inclusive Conversion Therapy Ban, including transgender, non-binary and asexual people. This has garnered significant attention and we will be continuing on with this as the year goes on.

We led on a cross-party letter opposing the use of Section 35 on the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Act by the UK government, alongside the Scottish Greens, Liberal Democrats, SNP, SDLP, and Alliance. In addition, we wrote an open letter to the Equality & Human Rights Commission (EHRC), opposing their trans-exclusive guidance on the Equality Act.

We have also worked with other groups in the Green Party to advance collective liberation of our communities, such as our work with Greens of Colour with Black Pride.

We are currently ongoing with our Pride support efforts, allowing local parties to use our two banners at their own local prides to represent the Green Party. This has had very positive feedback, alongside our pride resource packs that have been sent to local parties. If any other local party or group would like resources for a pride, please get in contact with us.

We have supported LGBTIQA+ Green candidates across the local elections and subsequent by-elections, in which multiple LGBTIQA+ Greens were successful in their elections, and we would like to congratulate them on becoming, or remaining, as Green councillors.

At Spring Conference, we ran a members meeting to give our members a chance to discuss and feed back campaign ideas to the committee. We would like to thank all the members who attended and gave their suggestions, and this has informed our work as to our priorities in campaigns.

We are currently in preparations for the upcoming Autumn Conference in Brighton, and so much of our work is around preparing for that.

## Synopsis
Motion to add to policy on trans rights to provide, in principle, for financial support.

## Motion
Add a new point RR539 into the Trans Rights section of the Responsibilities and Rights chapter of PSS.

The Green Party recognises that gender reassignment can create additional financial pressures for a trans person. GPEW supports the establishment of a Transition Benefit which can be awarded to a trans person to meet consequential expenses; additionally the Benefit could be paid as an alternative to Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance for any period where a trans person is not ready to seek employment.

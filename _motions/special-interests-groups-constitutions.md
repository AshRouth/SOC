**Special Interests groups constitutions**

GPEW’s Special Interests groups play an important role in shaping and implementing party policy and the running of the party’s instruments of governance. They also raise the profile of the GPEW within the communities their represent and are a great asset in mobilising volunteers at election time.

In existence for over a decade now, these group have developed their own constitutions, Standing Orders and other rules in an organic and/or fairly anarchic fashion. As a result, these documents not only vary hugely, but are also in need some proper scrutiny in terms of their remit and actual content.

There has been some talk of a Constitution and SOs templates to be put to members of all our Special Interest Groups for discussion and adoption.

This should be put to conference to debate.

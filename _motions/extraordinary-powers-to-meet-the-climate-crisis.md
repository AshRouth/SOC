## Synopsis

As the climate catastrophe develops it is clear that government is likely to require extraordinary powers to intervene in the economy and society. This proposal seeks to strengthen government powers to intervene in the distribution of goods, the operation of private companies, and prevent the dissemination of disinformation.

## M﻿otion

Amend the Climate Emergency chapter of Policies for a Sustainable Society as follows:

In CC110, in the first bullet point delete the words "limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C" and replace them with "first reduce UK emissions to net-zero, and then to achieve a negative carbon economy, having"

and in the second bullet point insert after “Prime Minister and the Climate Crisis Cabinet (see CC180), and answerable also to Parliament"

So that CC110 now reads:

"CC110 For clear accountability the UK should:

• Strengthen the Climate Change Act to require the Committee on Climate Change to set carbon budgets on the basis of the need to first reduce UK emissions to net-zero, and then to achieve a negative carbon economy, having respect for climate science and equity.

• Create a strategic Climate Emergency Agency directly responsible to the Prime Minister and the Climate Crisis Cabinet (see CC180), and answerable also to Parliament. It will have priority over any government policies that are inconsistent with climate emergency targets.

• Require all public bodies and businesses to define and make publicly available their own mitigation and adaptation plans, and report progress made in their implementation on a regular basis.

and add new paragraphs CC180-181 as follows:

CC 180 The Green Party calls for a cross-party Climate Crisis Cabinet to be established by the incoming Government after the next election, to include representation from all parties proportionally to their national share of votes at the election, and with a clear mission to bring our country to at least net zero carbon emissions more quickly than is currently planned; and this should be included in our Manifesto for the next General Election.

"CC181 A future government may need to legislate for extraordinary powers to support a rapid transition in the economy and society. Any such powers must be subject to judicial overview and Parliamentary and public scrutiny, should not be seen as permanent, and should be widely discussed and accepted in society.

CC182 Measures taken under CC181 might include:

• government control of industries, companies, and financial institutions to maximise development of renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure and reduce avoidable greenhouse gas emissions

• protection of supply chains to maintain equitable allocations of essential goods and services

• equitable regulation of transport usage and general resource usage

• regulating for a press and media free of editorial bias while also controlling the spread of factual misinformation

• regulating capital movements

• allocations of quantities of goods and services to private individuals or households.

CC183 Targeted financial, regulatory and administrative support will be provided to help promote robust initiatives by communities UK-wide seeking to adapt transformatively to climate-driven pressures and to strengthen local economic and social resilience generally.

Synopsis


Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC) currently excludes online attendees from the quorum for Conference. This amendment seeks to include online attendees in that quorum, and change quoracy for online and telephone extraordinary conference.


Motion


In SOCC:


Delete the existing text of G5.12 and replace with:
"Those registered to vote remotely will need to confirm their attendance on each day of Conference. Provision for this confirmation process will be made by SOC and the ERO. Confirmed remote attendees will receive a virtual equivalent of the voting card for the day, to be defined by SOC."


In H9.1 c), add "plus virtual equivalents" after "voting cards"; delete "(excluding those registered to vote remotely)"; and delete ", or for an online and telephone Extraordinary Conference as three hundred available to vote", so that the amended clause reads:
"H9.1 c) The quorum for conference shall be calculated as one third of voting cards plus virtual equivalents issued to attendees for that day at conference. A definition of the floor of conference shall be agreed in advance between SOC and Conferences Committee for any online and telephone Extraordinary Conference. For any decision on a motion or amendment but not for discussion on a motion or amendment the floor is required to be quorate."

## Synopsis
HIV affects every person regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity, and disproportionately impacts gay and bisexual men, trans people, those of Black African heritage, migrants, and people of colour. It is possible to end new cases of HIV by 2030. The Green Party must adopt the targets recommended by the HIV Commission and campaign to ensure health departments and the NHS and its partners do everything possible to end HIV transmissions by the end of the decade.

## Motion
Conference recognises that health is a fundamental human right. The vast majority of people diagnosed with HIV are promptly prescribed antiretroviral therapies and live long and healthy lives. Those on effective treatment cannot pass on the virus (Undetectable = Untransmissable). Since Terry Higgins was one of the first deaths from an AIDS related disease 40 years ago, the Terrence Higgins Trust has fought for better healthcare, HIV prevention, services, and for the rights of people living with HIV.

Conference notes and supports the recommendations made by the HIV Commission, founded by the Terrence Higgins Trust, the National AIDS Trust, and the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which provide recommendations on how to end new cases of HIV by 2030.

As Green Councillors in Brighton & Hove City Council and Caroline Lucas MP are leading in this fight to end HIV transmissions by 2030, this is the first city in the country to do so. Following Brighton & Hove Council’s lead, other NHS settings across England have adopted the opt-out HIV testing.

In October 2021, the Chancellor announced the Government’s future spending commitments – the campaign of HIV organisations and allies demanded vital funds. Investment is needed to win the fight against HIV and fully support everyone living with HIV.

Without new resources, we risk missing this once-in-a-generation opportunity to end the UK’s HIV epidemic. We now have the tools to end new cases of HIV and support everyone living with HIV, and yet each week, 60 people are still diagnosed with HIV, and many people living with HIV continue to experience poor mental health, stigma, and discrimination.

Conference instructs the Party to commit to and support the following actions:

Conference instructs the Green Party Executive to publicly and fully campaign for an end to new HIV transmissions by 2030.

Conference instructs the Green Party Executive to set up a working group and work in conjunction with the General Election steering group on how a Green Government would finance an end to HIV transmission with a Green Government.

Conference also instructs the Green Party Campaigns Coordinator and Campaigns Committee and the Association of Green Councillors to work with the LGBTIQA+ Greens on a fully pledged campaign, working with Councillors to bring motions forward at local authorities.

In: “HE1200 Sexual Health is a core provision of the NHS. The Green Party would provide more funding for sexual health awareness campaigns, provide greater access to free condoms and sexual health clinics.”,

Delete: “The Green Party would provide more funding for sexual health awareness campaigns, provide greater access to free condoms and sexual health clinics."

And insert: “A Green Government would invest further funding for a proper sexual health service, better healthcare for people living with HIV, and educational programs in the education system and healthcare settings, and would fight to see an end to stigma around HIV/AIDs and sexually transmitted diseases.”,

So the amended text now reads: “HE1200: Sexual Health is a core provision of the NHS. A Green Government would invest further funding for a proper sexual health service, better healthcare for people living with HIV, and educational programs in the education system and healthcare settings, and would fight to see an end to stigma around HIV/AIDs and sexually transmitted diseases.”

In: “HE1201 A Green Party would reprioritise the fight against HIV. More funding is required for public health campaigns, HIV prevention, and support for those living with HIV. The Green Party would introduce Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) on prescription on the NHS.”,

Delete: “A Green Party would reprioritise the fight against HIV. More funding is required for public health campaigns, HIV prevention, and support for those living with HIV. The Green Party would introduce Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) on prescription on the NHS.”,

And insert: “The Green Party would adopt the 2030 target recommended by the HIV Commission, and the new interim milestone recommended by the HIV Commission to see an 80% reduction in HIV transmission by 2025 The Green Party will seek to build on positive progress made to date and ensure that the Government commits to England being the first country to achieve this goal.

The Green Party will work with local NHS bodies to ensure pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available in GPs, pharmacies, and community-based groups, not just in sexual health clinics.”,

So the amended text now reads: “The Green Party will adopt the 2030 target recommended by the HIV Commission, and adopt the new interim milestone recommended by the HIV Commission to see an 80% reduction in HIV transmission by 2025. This would ensure the Government and reduction on cases remain on track. The Green Party will seek to build on positive progress made to date and ensure that the Government commits to England being the first country to achieve this goal.

The Green Party will work with local NHS bodies to ensure pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available in GPs, pharmacies, and community-based groups, not just in sexual health clinics.”

In: “HE1202 Early diagnosis of HIV is a vital part of curbing new cases of HIV and protecting the health of those diagnosed with HIV. The Green Party would invest money in enabling all sexually active adults to regularly undertake sexual health screenings. This can include new modes of testing like home screenings.”

Delete: “Early diagnosis of HIV is a vital part of curbing new cases of HIV and protecting the health of those diagnosed with HIV. The Green Party would invest money in enabling all sexually active adults to regularly undertake sexual health screenings. This can include new modes of testing like home screenings.”

And insert: “The Green Party supports the opt-out HIV testing across all NHS settings. HIV testing should be routinely offered to patients in relevant settings, such as GP surgeries, A&E departments, and in all sexual health clinics.

The Green Party will ensure home testing kits for HIV are made available in all local authorities and to explore the option of providing free HIV self-testing kits to those at highest risk of HIV.

So the amended text now reads: “HE1202

The Green Party supports the opt-out HIV testing across all NHS settings. HIV testing should be routinely offered to patients in relevant settings, such as GP surgeries, A&E departments, and in all sexual health clinics.

The Green Party will ensure HIV testing at home being made available in all local authorities and the exploration of the option of providing free HIV self-testing kits to those at highest risk of HIV.”

HE1203 Fighting HIV stigma is vital to curbing new cases of HIV as well as improving the wellbeing of those living with HIV. Raising awareness and fighting stigma should be a part of compulsory sexual education in schools as well as public awareness campaigns.

Delete HE1203 and replace with:

With increased funding for sexual health services that will feed into improved pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access and eliminate financial/time barriers and regional inequalities, the Green Party will work with local NHS bodies to ensure pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) availabile in GPs, pharmacies and community based groups, not just sexual health clinics, and ensure bespoke mental health support is made available to all living with HIV.

Public bodies, such as TfL, to use their advertising space to encourage HIV testing and fight stigma. Public bodies and private companies will provide free advertising and commercial advertising space to encourage HIV testing and up to date information about HIV.

A Green Government will undertake a widespread evidence based communications campaign to promote HIV testing.

A Green Government will reverse the £1pm cut to the sexual health proposition of the Public Health Grant as a first step to funding a modern, accessible and proactive sexual health service that isn’t just about people being disease free and increase media representations of people living with HIV, e.g. a public health campaign about U=U

The Green Party will work with other organisations such as the Terrence Higgins Trust, the National AIDs Trusts, and the HIV Commission to work cross-party and intergovernmental to fight for an end to HIV transmissions.

HE1203 will now read as follows:

The Green Party will work with local NHS bodies to ensure pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available in GPs, pharmacies and community based groups, not just sexual health clinics and ensure bespoke mental health support being made available to all living with HIV.

Public bodies, such as TfL, to use their advertising space to encourage HIV testing and fight stigma. Public bodies and private companies will provide free advertising and commercial advertising space to encourage HIV testing and up to date information about HIV.

After HE1203 add HE1204:

The Green Party will publicly campaign for an end new HIV transmissions by 2030. The Green Party will work with other organisations such as the Terrence Higgins Trust, the National AIDS Trusts, and the HIV Commission to work cross-party and intergovernmental to fight for an end to HIV transmissions.

A Green Government will create an AIDs Memorial in every region across England and Wales, to remember those who have died from AIDs related diseases.

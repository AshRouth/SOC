Conference recognises that health is a fundamental human right. The vast majority of people diagnosed with HIV are promptly prescribed antiretroviral therapies and live long and healthy lives.

Since Terry Higgins was one of the first deaths from an AIDS related disease 40 years ago, the Terrence Higgins Trust has fought for better healthcare, HIV prevention, services, and for the rights of people living with HIV.

Conference notes and supports the recommendations made by the HIV Commission, founded by the Terrence Higgins Trust, the National AIDS Trust, and the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which provide recommendations on how to end new cases of HIV by 2030.

Conference also instructs the Green Party Campaigns Coordinator and Campaigns Committee and the Association of Green Councillors to work with the LGBTIQA+ Greens on a fully pledged campaign, working with Councillors to bring motions forward at local authorities.

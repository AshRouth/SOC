## Synopsis
Europe PWG offers an interim revision of the opening of the Europe Chapter, to align with GPEWâ€™s current vision on Europe. While the new chapter under construction will ultimately replace these sections, we propose pro tem to clean up some problematic statements, and thereby test our intuitions for the remainder.

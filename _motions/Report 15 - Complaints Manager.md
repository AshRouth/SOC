## Motion
To accept the following report from the Complaint
Manager:

The Standing Orders for Party Discipline require the Complaints Manager to report all decisions of censure, suspension and expulsion, taken by the Disciplinary Committee, to Conference.

The Disciplinary Committee met 9 times since August 2021:
- 25 Sept 2021
- 30 Oct 2021
- 27 Nov 2021
- 29 Jan 2022
- 26 Feb 2022
- 23 March 2022
- 30 April 2022
- 28 May 2022
- 25 June 2022
Of the 22 cases heard by the Disciplinary Committee and reported back to the Complaints Manager between 01 August 2021 – 30 June 2022:
- 6 complaints were dismissed
- 2 complaints were dropped on request of both parties
- 1 complaint ceased as the member resigned
- 3 complaints resulted in no sanction
- 2 complaints resulted in a censure
- 2 complaints received sanctions
- 5 complaints resulted in disciplinary suspensions of membership
- 1 complaint resulted in an expulsion

The Complaints Manager is also required to report all Appeal decisions to Conference. The Green Party Regional Council Appeals Sub Committee has considered 4 appeals between 01 August 2021 – 30 August 2022:
12 April 2022 appeal upheld and sanctions revised
12 May 2022 Appeal upheld and sanctions revised
12 May 2022 appeal upheld and complaint dismissed
26 May 2022 appeal upheld and case referred back to Disciplinary Committee
In the autumn of 2021, an external review of the disputes and disciplinary process was commissioned by a group made up of all those bodies in the party involved in the process. In January 2022, that group met to consider the findings of the report and to begin the processes of implementing them. This work
is on-going.

Conference is whole heartedly requested to support the motion to expand Disciplinary Committee. Given the expansion in complaint numbers over the last years, more capacity is needed to progress complaints in a timely and effective manner. The current delays cause real distress for all involved and do not serve the party’s interests.

I wish to record my thanks to all involved in the disciplinary and disputes process, including those working at a regional level and in appeals, and to the on-going work of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee. I particularly wish to recognise the incredible hard work of current and former members of Disciplinary Committee.

Forget inconvenient truths. Two appalling truths are now clear:

1. We will not keep below 1.5 C and probably not below 2C. In principle we could but in practice we wonâ€™t,
2. The long-term consequences of the greenhouse gases NOW in the air will be several times larger than we thought. Hansen now suggests a temperature increase of up to 10C.

This calls for some extensions of our climate policy.

1. We should urge the UNFCCC to set targets for the amounts of greenhouse gases in the air and these targets should be low enough to keep us below 1.5C.
2. The UK should aim to become a net absorber of greenhouse gases by developing and deploying carbon sequestration.

These are the right polices for the long-term but they will, in the real world, leave us going over 1.5C for several decades of this century. Since this could trigger one or more climate tripping points we need to do whatever it takes to keep below. And only viable option seems to be

3. Solar Radiation Management, ie screening out some sunlight for as long as it takes to get emissions down and carbon sequestration up enough.

The most urgent climate priority is to minimise the risk of passing tipping points and this is a global challenge.

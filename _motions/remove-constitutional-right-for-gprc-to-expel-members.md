## Synopsis

The constitution allows GPRC to expel people. The committee itself has spent the last 6 months discussing if it can. It is clear that this right only exists on paper, and it is better to be removed, rather than potentially exist until the point the committee wishes to exercise it.

## Motion

In Part viii of section 4 of the constitution:

viii)  The Green Party Regional Council (hereinafter referred to as the Regional Council) shall have the power to expel or suspend any person from membership and/or refuse membership to any person for a specified period if in its opinion it is in the Party's interest to do so. Where necessary to avoid or reduce the likelihood of further harm to the Party, a member under investigation may be suspended temporarily by decision of the Regional Council or those members of it empowered to act on its behalf while that takes place, but no member may be expelled without proper consideration. The Local Party shall not offer Associate Membership to any person who has been expelled from or refused membership of the Green Party.

Delete:

“expel or”

And

“, but no member may be expelled without proper consideration.”

Move the following:

“The Local Party shall not offer Associate Membership to any person who has been expelled from or refused membership of the Green Party. “

To create a new part x in section 4 of the constitution and renumber accordingly.

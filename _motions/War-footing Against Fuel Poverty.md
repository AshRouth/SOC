## Synopsis
The UK has many poorly-insulated, vintage homes. They need a makeover to reduce fuel-use and make them comfortable. Four million UK households are in ‘fuel poverty’, put beneath the poverty line by paying their fuel bills. *End Fuel Poverty Coalition*, predicts that by October 2022, rising fuel bills will plunge

## Motion
That the Green Party advocate that the country goes on a war-footing, to provide fuel security, make home-heating affordable, protect our people from ill-health and death, and tackle climate change.

Government and local councils should work together to create a systems-approach to mass-rollout of retrofit.

Builders and materials should be requisitioned, and skilled tradespeople and construction workers retrained, for the complex, intricate, specialised work of retrofit. We need mass-mobilisation of an army of surveyors, energy-advisors and retrofit co-ordinators. The knowledge and resources of volume house-builders should be re-directed to this task.

Insulation, heat-pumps, solar panels and other materials should be requisitioned in this strategic push. Limited resources mean we should switch focus from building new homes to making our existing homes fit for the future.

We call on Government to provide a war-chest to pump-prime this new industry with constant, reliable, long-term funding. Around £30bn was to be produced by Government to help with fuel bills in the winter of 2022. That is the annual quantum that should be spent to create the structural mechanism, and to retrofit a million homes a year.

Targetted investment in our homes will reap secure benefits and an economic boom, with a ready market of 28.5 million householders, and excellent, skilled, local work.

A structure similar to the Green Deal of 2013-2015 should be created, but without its fatal flaws and complex financial arrangements. It had a three-pronged approach of advisers, providers (of finance) and installers. Retrofit co-ordinators should replace the providers and the financing should be simple, as a grant to poorer homes and a zero interest loan, with the home as surety, for able-to-pay households.

The time for retrofit is now. Britain could develop a world-class innovatory strategy for mass-retrofit. As a  country that excels in service and managerial provision, the UK could sell this new expertise on, leading from the front of global development in retrofit.

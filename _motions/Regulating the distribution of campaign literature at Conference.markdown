## Synopsis

There is currently no regulation of campaign literature in Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC). This amendment seeks to add regulation guidelines in order to reduce disruption to plenary, and maintain a fair campaigning environment.

## Motion

In SOCC:

Add the following new clause after H13.9:
"H14 Campaign literature at Conference

H14.1 Campaign literature shall be understood to mean physical media used to promote some cause, group, policy, or motion.

H14.2 Campaign literature may not be pro-actively distributed to Conference attendees. This includes leaving literature on seats ahead of plenary, handing out literature during plenary, or approaching members generally in order to hand them literature.

H14.3 Members wishing to distribute campaign literature at Conference may do so via stalls booked for this purpose, and to attendees at fringe events with permission from the event organiser.

H14.4 Campaign literature must bear an imprint identifying a sponsoring Party member (with local Party specified), or local Party, or special interest group. This sponsor shall be considered responsible for the content of the literature.

H14.5 A maximum limit of Â£200 shall apply to the cost of producing campaign literature.

H14.6 Campaign literature should seek to be factual and non-discriminatory. Where there is concern about the content of some campaign literature, this should be raised with GPRC Reps at conference, who shall be empowered to require its removal if deemed unacceptable."

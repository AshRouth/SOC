## **Motion**

\
**Add to Record of Policy Statements:**\
Recognising the manner in which some members of society are treated adversely following their having been in care as a young person, the Green Party endorses ‘Care Experience’ as a protected characteristic under the Equalities Act 2010.\
We request elected members to propose motions at their respective councils and assemblies, ensuring people who have had experience of being in care are thus protected, or to vote in favour should others so propose.\
We request our Parliamentarians to propose the Equalities Act 2010 be updated to include ‘Care Experience’ as a protected characteristic.

## Synopsis
Local parties are selecting General Election candidates ahead of the next election. A recent update of the General Election candidate selection guidance has clarified the process for local parties but this motion aims to make three changes to the bye-laws on General Election candidate selection to improve the process further.

## Motion
In Clause 5(xvii) of the constitutional bylaws (Selection of Candidates for the House of Commons)

Replace (9):

Each nominee must have been a member of the GPEW for at least one year by the last possible date for the election and must hold continuous membership up to the date of the election. However, an exemption from this requirement may be granted by GPRC if at least ten nominating signatures are obtained from fully paid up members resident in the area which the Local Party has agreed as the area from which selection will take place.  This could be the constituency or the territory covered by the Local Party (see 3a).

With a new (9)

Each nominee must have been a member of the GPEW for at least one year by the internal nomination deadline set by the ERO, to seek nomination as a constituency candidate, and must hold continuous membership up to the date of the election. However, an exemption from this requirement may be granted by GPRC if at least two nominating signatures are obtained from fully paid up members resident in the area which the Local Party has agreed as the area from which selection will take place.  This could be the constituency or the territory covered by the Local Party (see 3a).

Replace (12, 1):

A ballot on whether to de-select a Parliamentary candidate will be held if a petition demanding one is supported by at least 20% of the Party members in the territory originally balloted.

With a new (12, 1):

A ballot on whether to de-select a Parliamentary candidate will be held if a petition demanding one is supported by a resolution of and local party committee from within the area covered by the constituency, requesting authority from the GPRC on-call members.

Delete from (12, 4):

‘informing the National Election Agent and’

End

RE 12,1 - I will submit an amendment to the motion to change 12,1 from “any” to “all” so that conference is able to choose between these two options.

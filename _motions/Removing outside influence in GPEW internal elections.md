## Synopsis
This motion will ban members from voting in national internal elections in the first 3 months of their membership. This will ensure that the results of our national internal elections are what our membership want and not influenced by candidates recruiting new members to join just to vote for them.

## Motion
In the Constitution add to 17. Elections:

v) All Green Party members will be eligible to vote in national elections after they have been a member for a minimum of three months at the close of nominations.

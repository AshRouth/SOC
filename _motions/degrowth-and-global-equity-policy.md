For the Record of Policy Statements:

We must deal with the climate and ecological emergency together. This will involve substantial efforts to make existing resource use more circular (such as through better reuse and recycling). This will however not be enough if the UK and global resource use continues to grow.Â  Therefore, we accept that the transition to zero carbon will require us to reduce overall resource use to within environmental limits.'

We also accept that demand for critical minerals and resources, including copper will increase in the short term, as these are vital to the deployment of renewable energy and other zero carbon enabling technologies in the UK and around the world.

Extraction of these materials has the potential to damage the local environment, undermine civil rights and perpetuate inequality, and will increase the need to establish governance mechanisms to protect people and the environment in places where resources are found.

We accept that the UK has benefited from historic imperialism, and this has allowed it to extract and consume an unfair share of the world's resources, including copper. This is ethically unacceptable and should not continue.

A fair distribution of the world's resources should begin with the principle that all people have equal moral value. Resources would ideally be distributed between countries on the basis of their population. Britain has 0.8% of the world population, and we use roughly 2.3% of the world's resources. This is 3x more than is equitable.

Therefore for the sake of sustainability and global equity the UK should introduce policies to restrict our use of copper and critical minerals and resources and plan to work within national budgets for these globally scarce resources.

As we take steps to move within these resource budgets, we must ensure that economic inequality is reduced within the UK, such that we are still able to provide a decent quality of life for all (see PB308).

The next general election manifesto will be written to reflect these policy principles

## Synopsis

20% of NHS spending treats avoidable illness from wider determinants of health; poor employment, poverty, poor housing, pollution, transport and poor local amenities.  The right policies will reduce NHS and social care demand. The policy framework in the report 'Fair Society, Healthy Lives' can test and refine all our policies.

## Motion

That conference approves a ‘Health in All Policies’ approach and utilises the policy framework in the report “Fair Society, Healthy Lives in order that all of our policies are aligned to the following aims, designed to reduce health inequality.

A          Give every child the best start in life.

B          Enable all children, young people and adults to maximise their capabilities and have control over their lives.

C          Create fair employment and good work for all.

D          Ensure a healthy standard of living for all.

E          Create and develop healthy and sustainable places and communities.

F          Strengthen the role and impact of health prevention.

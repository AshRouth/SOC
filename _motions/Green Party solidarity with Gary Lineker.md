## Motion
Green Party conference expresses solidarity with Gary Lineker and instructs the External Communicator to call on the BBC to reverse the decision to remove him from Match of the Day.
The party believes in the principle of BBC impartiality and is clear the organisation is making a mockery of its own policy in this instance. Instead, they are bowing to party political pressure and undermining free speech in the process. 

{% include amendment.html number="1" status="passed" %}

Although we would not have used the same language as Gary Lineker, we believe that the point he was making around the deliberately cruel approach to Conservative asylum policy was entirely valid.
The Conservativesâ€™ deliberate stoking of this issue as part of their incessant culture war also serves as a distraction from the urgent humanitarian crisis on our doorstep. The issue of desperate refugees should not be used as a political football.

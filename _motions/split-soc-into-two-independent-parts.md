## S﻿ynopsis

Motion

This motion calls on conference to make the following changes to the constitution to create two new governance bodies to take over the work currently done by Standing Orders Committee (SOC) and to enact this through the transition process outlined.

Constitution Interpretation Committee Standing Orders

1. Introduction

These Standing Orders are intended to set out basic principles that should shape the way in which CIC makes decisions. It is in addition to the rules and procedures established in the Constitution. Should there be a conflict of interpretation between these standing orders and the Constitution then the Constitution takes precedence. These standing orders will be agreed at Conference from time to time via the CIC report.

2. CIC Convenor

Within a week of the end of each Autumn Conference CIC will appoint a convenor. In the event of a vacancy CIC must appoint a replacement within a week. The CIC convenor is appointed, or removed by a vote of no confidence, by a minimum of three members of CIC, or a simple majority if there are less than five members of CIC.

Within a week of their appointment following each Conference, the convenor must notify all members of CIC, the Conferences Committee Convenor, Policy Development Committee Convenor, the Green Party regional Committee (GPRC) Co-chairs and the Green Party Executive (GPEx) chair, of the time & place for meetings to discuss the first and final agenda for the forthcoming Conference.

The Convenor will maintain a copy of these standing orders.

3. Principles of Decision-Making

CIC will operate to the highest standards of accountability and transparency as regards decision-making. The key principles (in addition to those set out in the Constitution are):

a) Decisions will always be in writing and make reference to the relevant sections of the party's Constitutional documents or other relevant principles;

b) Where possible decisions will be taken by consensus of all members of CIC; where this is not possible (except where stated otherwise) all decisions will require that both a majority of members voted and that a majority voted for the proposal;

c) co-optees to the Committee will be allowed to vote but their votes will not count towards determining if either of the required majorities have been reached;

d) All decisions shall be taken with the knowledge of each member of CIC or one its sub-committees where possible;

e) Some decisions must be taken at one of the two meetings in (2) above. However it is recognised that there are times when it is desirable to take decisions in other ways.

4. Decisions That Must Be Taken at a Formal Meeting of CIC

4.1

a) The content of the CIC report

b) Changes to these Standing Orders

4.2 All other decisions can be taken at either a formal meeting, by a discussion and vote on the e-list or by remote conference. The procedures for these are below.

4.3 Decision by E-list.

The CIC Convenor will maintain an E-mail list (‘E-list’) to which all CIC members and the Returning Officer can post items and any Green Party member can join on a ‘read-only’ basis. CIC members must therefore ensure that the CIC Convenor has a current email address, contact number, or other means of contacting you.

The CIC Convenor will have the sole discretion to determine whether an item is suitable for decision by E-list with the exception of a vote of no confidence in the CIC Convenor. Before doing so the Convenor should consider the complexity of the decision to hand and the ability to have a proper discussion via the E-list. Generally, it is anticipated that prior to a request for a formal decision by email, a discussion about the issue will have taken place on the E-list and this will assist the Convenor in reaching his/her decision.

Once the Convenor has decided to use the ‘E- List

Green Party Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference Revised Autumn 2021 list’ they should post a simple email covering each decision to the list stating in the subject ‘DECISION BY XX/YY/ZZ ON \[SUBJECT]’. In the text of the email the Convenor should explain the decision to be made, make the relevant references to the Constitution and confirm the deadline for a response. The deadline for response should be no less than 48 hours. Further, if the deadline is less than 72 hours the Convenor should attempt to alert the SOC members of the vote by the fastest means possible taking into account the accessibility requirements of the particular members of SOC at the time. Members of SOC should vote by simply replying to the list ‘FOR’ ‘AGAINST’ or ‘ABSTAIN’.

4.4 Decision by Remote Conference

Notice of a remote conference should be published on the SOC E-list along with a note of the business to be discussed during the conference at least 24 hours in advance of the remote conference. CIC may invite relevant people to participate in the conference. Requests from members to ‘listen in ’ will normally be accepted. However, such members have no automatic right to actively participate in the discussion.

Minutes covering decisions taken, the reasons for them, and votes cast will be circulated by the Convenor (or a person nominated by the Convenor) on the E-list within 24 hours of the end of the remote conference. So that a contemporaneous record is kept of these conferences, when the Convenor posts the minutes onto the E-list he/she will do so by invoking the ‘E-list’ on a proposal to accept the accuracy of the minutes.

5. CIC Rulings

SOC will receive requests for rulings from time to time. SOC should refrain from issuing rulings based on vague and hypothetical situations since this could lead to the application of rulings out of context.

6. Emergency Business - Suspension of Standing Orders

If all members of CIC agree, these standing orders can be suspended for the purposes of a particular decision. However specifically business covered by 4.1 above cannot be discussed whilst these standing orders are suspended.

7. Changes to these Standing Orders

7.1 These Standing Orders can only be amended at a formal meeting of the Committee.

7.2 These Standing Orders will be agreed at Conference from time to time, but no longer than annually, via the CIC report.

8. The CIC Report

The CIC Report should contain the following:

(a) Rulings made and the reasons for them

(b) A list of the decisions made by E-list and Remote Conference

Transition

At the next Annual ballot following the passing of this motion a new Constitution Interpretation Committee will be elected.

The current members of Standing Orders Committee may stand for election to the CIC.

When the new CIC is elected, existing members of SOC will the constitute the CBC until the next Annual Conference.

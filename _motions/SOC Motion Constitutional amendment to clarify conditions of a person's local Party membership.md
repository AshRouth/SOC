## Synopsis
By convention, new members are assigned to a local Party based on where they live. Members can change their local Party by request. This amendment would make current convention explicit.

## Motion
In 4.ii of the Constitution, after "Membership shall be of the smallest appropriate Party", insert:

"New members shall automatically be assigned to a local Party based on their home postcode. Members may choose to switch their membership to any other local Party within GPEW provided the executive of that local Party agree".

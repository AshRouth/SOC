## Synopsis
Capitalism is incompatible with a just society and a sustainable future. The exploitation of people and the planet, necessitated by capitalism, is fundamentally contradictory with Green principles; there can be no sustainable society under a system which is defined by constant growth.

## Motion
SOC notes: This motion will require a two-thirds majority to pass.

To PB107 add the following text after “Rather than set them against each other, the Green Party seeks healthy interdependence of individual, nature and society.”

“The Green Party of England and Wales will be an Eco-Socialist party. The purpose of the Green Party of England and Wales will be to work toward a non- violent, democratic, just, and sustainable society free from the predations and inequities of capitalism. To this end, the Green Party of England and Wales will contest elections open to the English and Welsh electorates. We do not believe that electoral politics is the only way to change society, or that we have all the answers. We, therefore, seek to facilitate and cooperate with movements and initiatives which share our values, principles and objectives to achieve change through a variety of non-violent means, tactics and strategies.”

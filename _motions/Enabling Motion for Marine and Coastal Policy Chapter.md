## Synopsis
The current Marine & Coastal chapter in Policies for a Sustainable Society dates back to 2007 and urgently needs updating, not least to reflect developments since the UK left the EU. A new Marine & Coastal policy working group has been convened to take this work forward.

## Motion
This Conference instructs the Policy Development Committee to initiate a policy development process to rewrite and update the Marine and Coastal chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society. The process will be undertaken by the Marine and Coastal Policy Working Group who will refer to the core values and philosophical basis of GPEW and seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in this area and other related fields. Liaison and reference will be made to other GPEW policy working groups where appropriate. Views of other relevant organisations and professionals will also be sought and referenced in the background paper.

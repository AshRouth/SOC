## Synopsis


## Motion
The chapter has not been updated for 14 years. It provides plenty of detail on Middle East including many background facts and the situation which has continued.

A review of the chapter would allow various regions and diplomacy to be brought together in one paper that would gain sufficient traction to enter into the Policies for a Sustainable Society.

It would bring together the work parliamentarians have been doing on the Procurement Bill with respect to the long term polysilicon supply contracts 45% of which come from the Uyghur region being subject to forced labour.

Tibet self-determination would be restored and recognised reversing the 2008 UK Government foreign policy change.

The details could be hammered out in free and open debate safe from the long arms of the state with a bold and brave party in the face of any intimidation from the powerful.

The motion will recognise from the ecological policy platform of the Green Party, the strategic importance of the Tibetan Plateu outlined by the excellent Tibetan delegation to the COP27 which provided fringe events and briefing to officials despite the lack of representation from China’s representatives. The ecology of the Tibetan plateu is important and the many glaciers on what is called the “roof of the world” is a source of major rivers.

The International chapter would cement the green policy resolving the long term ambiguity left by the British colonialism in Kashmir, in a framework of Green Party aims for the long term.

The chapter would provide a political narrative to guide our representatives through the rights of refugees, based on a decent majority at conference and the deliberation provided by the International Policy Working Group.

The Group will be totally independent from the international sub-committee which is the constitutional body that nominates our delegations to the EGP and Global Greens.

## **Synopsis**

Over the years many things have gone to landfills that should instead have been recycled. Landfills take up land which could be better used for other purposes. Landfill mining is the practice of removing materials from landfills on mass, and processing them for better use.

## **Motion**

Insert after NR 425:

Alongside efforts to minimize the amount of waste going to landfill (see NR416) the green party will initiate a program of landfill mining, to clear as much waste as possible from existing landfills, and recycle it. Land freed up in this way will be converted into parks, natural habitats or community centers, as needed by the local community.

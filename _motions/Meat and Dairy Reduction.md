## Motion
Draft Statement of Policy on Meat and Dairy Reduction

Process for development

This statement builds on the existing commitment in policy to reduce meat and dairy, setting out in more detail how and why. The full policy working group agreed this approach at a poliycfest session in Jan 2022. A small group worked on a draft statement via email and several meetings, and a draft went to a further meeting of the full PWG at policy fest in June 22. This version of the statement reflects feedback from that meeting and subsequently from the smaller group by email. The wider principles have already had substantial discussion, and it has been challenging to reach the compromise position below.

One aspect does need further input - the proposed fruit & veg subsidy scheme aimed at children (currently framed as a revamp of the existing Healthy Start scheme) and further feedback on this particularly welcome.

Draft Statement:

Climate change modelling acknowledges that we need to reduce meat and dairy consumption to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown.  A shift in consumer habits is already underway but needs to accelerate. This will be hard. Food is complicated and emotive and changing people’s diets is not like changing their boiler.  The cost of living crisis means many are experiencing food poverty and we need to ensure people in need aren’t penalised.

This statement shows how the Green Party would achieve a substantial reduction in meat and dairy consumption, and the consequent carbon emissions, both through engaging with the public and through ensuring protection and support for farmers and food producers and a strong, sustainable rural economy.

Step 1: Mass public engagement :

A mass marketing & cooking skills campaign with positive messaging including health & economic benefits of alternatives such as pulses.
A ban on advertising high-carbon foods.
A  ‘whole school food’ education programme  which includes school meals and school curriculum.
A reform of the Government's failing healthy start scheme which would
Provide a universal voucher for  all children  [aged 5 and under / or 11 and under? - to discuss] to subside fruit, veg and milk - including plant milk alternatives.
Increase the voucher value to a realistic level [e.g. £10 per child? ]
Pilot ways this subsidy can support local and sustainable fruit and veg production, based on localising models such as beetroot bonds
(updated following consensus  at meeting on 13/6 there should be a subsidy scheme and broad support for focussing on children - but needs further refinement)
Step 2: restore farming subsidies to former EU levels and beyond, & radically reframe them to support the shift to ‘less better’ meat and dairy and a ‘just transition’ for farmers including:

Reduce and ultimately end subsidies for high-carbon practices such as beef farming and farming on peatlands.
Move that investment to support nature, climate and health-friendly methods including smaller mixed farms, pasture fed, wild meat (e.g. venison), woodland pasture. Also invest in non-animal protein  e.g. nut trees, legumes, and horticulture (fruit & veg) - that capture carbon, enhance nature AND produce good food.
Mass green skills training programme for people working in farming and the wider food economy (including processing, retail & hospitality) including use of meat/dairy alternatives.
Step 3:  Make visible the real cost of meat and dairy:

This means meat will become more ‘luxury’ (as it was in the pre -cheap-meat era) so MUST be alongside green party policies such as universal basic income and proper welfare benefits, which empower and enable people to make their own food choices.

Ensure labels and advertising for meat and dairy clearly show all carbon emissions, animal welfare levels and production methods
Introduce VAT for meat and Dairy (they are currently exempt i.e. zero rated.)
Phase in a carbon tax covering farm emissions including enteric fermentation - i.e. methane from livestock burps (mainly cow and sheep) as well as inputs such as fuel and fertiliser. The revenues from this part of the Carbon Tax will be recycled back into farming, and will be spent on measures to help farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods.  Imported meat and dairy would be covered by a carbon tax on imports. (updated following consensus at meeting on 13th June 2022)
What are the other benefits?

Greater food security and stronger rural economies.
Addressing  biodiversity loss and soil quality loss - farming produces not just our food but our landscapes and our ecosystems
Benefits for  water quality (agricultural pesticide & fertilisers are the biggest contributors to river pollution)
Healthier diets, meaning savings to the NHS.  Sustain estimates that meat over-consumption costs the NHS directly £1.2 billion, and 45,000 deaths annually. The National Food Strategy states that obesity alone accounts for 8% of annual health spend in the UK, or £18bn.

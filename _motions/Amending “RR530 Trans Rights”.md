## Synopsis
Much has happened outside, and within the Green Party, since this policy was approved at the 2016 Autumn Conference with C4 motion “Recognising Trans identities” proposed by Aimee Challenor. The time has come for an update and for the party to resolve what has been a deeply divisive policy.

## Motion

Proposed amendments in bold

The Green Party recognises that there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party **acknowledges the belief** that trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary people’s identities exist and are valid.

Insert new paragraph

**It also acknowledges that the gender critical belief that biological sex is real, important, immutable and not to be conflated with gender identity is protected under the Equality Act 2010 and is equally valid.**

Insert new paragraph

**The Green Party accepts that it is unlawful to discriminate against or harass members for holding or expressing gender critical beliefs which are Protected Characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 (‘EqA10’) and Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR”).**

We shall respect transgender and non-binary people's identities as real. The Green Party shall include and push for further acceptance of transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society

and add

**and will continue to support the human rights of natal women and men and the human rights of transgender and non-binary people.**

**So that RR530 reads**

## Synopsis

## Motion

Motion E08 at Autumn Conference 2021 inserted a new section in PSS (new clauses PA360-369) concerning the regulation of election spending, and one new clause (PA354) into the preceeding section concerning political party funding as follows:

PA354. Political party donations by companies are undemocratic, as they do not require specific approval by shareholders and provide no opportunity for individual shareholders to opt out. They also provide loopholes for the evasion of any limits on individual donations and for disguising the true source of donations. Limited companies will therefore not be permitted to make donations to political parties.

This motion was fast tracked, and was therefore passed without a plenary debate, although an issue with PA354 was raised during the preceding workshop debate, which the proposers undertook to address with a further amendment at the first available subsequent conference.

Such an amendment is reasonable and proportionate in relation to the policy passed, does not significantly alter the principles of that policy, and is also necessary to avoid any possible embarrassment to the Party in relation to the small number of relatively small donations it receives from small limited companies at the present time.

Proposed addition to the above policy, following Autumn Conference 2021

In PA354: Before “Limited” insert “Public”, so final sentence reads “Public Limited companies will therefore not be permitted to make donations to political parties.”

Insert new PA355: Other limited liability bodies (smaller limited companies, companies limited by guarantee, community interest companies, limitied liability partnerships etc.) would be able to make political party donations subject to an annual limit in line with that for donations by individuals, provided such donations are approved annually in advance by a resolution of the members of that organisation.

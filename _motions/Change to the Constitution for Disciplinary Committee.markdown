## Synopsis

If there is no proposal to introduce a new Constitution which includes the Disputes, Complaints and Disciplinary system / procedures then the Disciplinary Committee proposes to expand the committee from eleven to twenty members.

## Motion

Increase the number of Disciplinary Committee members from eleven to twenty, and allow appointment as well as election.

Delete the text of clause 4 (x) of the current constitution:

“There shall be a Disciplinary Committee, elected to handle all complaints of a disciplinary nature which have not been resolved at Regional or Local Party level. The committee will comprise eleven members, one member from each region, one from the Wales Green Party and a member elected biennially at the autumn conference. The term of office will be two years.”

And replace it with:

“There shall be a Disciplinary Committee, responsible for handling all complaints of a disciplinary nature that have not been or cannot be resolved at Local, Regional or Wales Green Party level, or by another Party body formally recognised by the Green Party Regional Council, and where mediation has been declined or been unsuccessful. The Disciplinary Committee shall comprise members elected or appointed by Wales Green Party and the English Regions in accordance with their respective Constitutions. The term of office will be two years.”

## Synopsis

Rolls Royce and the UK gov’t have recently proposed that RR could begin manufacturing Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMR’s). This possibility is being praised on various grounds including:

· That SMR’s pose less investment risk than larger nuclear power stations and could potentially be profitable.

· That SMR’s would enable [Note from SOC - Synopsis word limit reached]

## Motion

The Green Party opposes the proposal that Rolls Royce or other manufacturers make Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMR’s). It reaffirms its opposition to nuclear power which is a false solution to the urgent problem of human caused climate change.  Failures of existing nuclear power stations demonstrate that nuclear is an inherently dangerous technology.

A proliferation of nuclear via SMR’s would not provide a sustainable solution to human caused climate change as renewable energy generation does.  Additionally numerous SMR’s would make the long- and short-term dangers of nuclear power more widespread.

The Green Party therefore calls on Rolls Royce and the UK gov’t to encourage the workers of RR and other appropriate manufacturers to use their skills and experience to design and build truly climate friendly technologies and products rather than waste time on the false solution offered by SMR’s’.

## Synopsis

Turnout for the Green Partyâ€™s leadership elections is the lowest of any major political party. Our highest turnout in the last decade is a paltry 30%

We need to commission a party to review to establish actions we can take.

## Motion

Insert into Record of Organisational Statements:

Conference instructs Green Party Regional Council to create a working group consisting of GPEx, GPRC, Special Interest Groups, Regional EROs and SOC to address low turnout in Green Party leadership elections.

The group should consider the following questions:

Should leadership campaigns be given access to membership data and what controls/rules are needed?

Should the ban on leaflets be dropped?

Should the ban on endorsements or social media use in all internal selections be dropped?

What spending caps are appropriate for each type of internal election?

What is an effective frequency of internal comms to push turnout?

What platforms work best for running internal selections?

When should the cut off be for new members and their right to vote?

Should a right to hustings be guaranteed for all elected roles?

Address whether leadership elections should be every 4 years instead of two years?

How do we ensure a wider pool of people, from underrepresented groups, are standing for roles?

This working group will be:

Convened in Spring 2022

Run workshops online and at Autumn Conference 2022

Present a set of options to be voted on at Spring Conference 2023

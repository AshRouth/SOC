Synopsis


At the present moment in time the number of carers in the UK is an unknown number, with the government using data about claims for Carer’s Allowance and charities using data based on referrals


Motion


If adopted, the policy would read “A carer is a person who looks after someone else, either directly related or not related, whilst that person suffers from a medical, psychological or mental health illness” and create a legal definition of a carer so that when the media say “carers” the public knows what is being discussed

## Motion
"The government's guidance on Investment Zones in England issued on 24th September has the stated aims of "liberalising planning laws", so that "the planning system will not stand in the way of investment and development". These constitute a huge threat to wildlife and eco-systems especially when combined with so called Freeports that cover significant areas of natural beauty including Dartmoor, the New Forest and the whole of the Isle of Wight and the North York Moors. For the sake of local democracy and nature we urge councillors of all parties to resist the imposition of unfettered capitalism on local areas and to join with the RSPB and other conservation groups in their urgent campaign against the Governmentâ€™s attack on nature and to promote an alternative approach based uponpartnership and democratic controls."

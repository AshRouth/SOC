## Synopsis
Costed proposals for UBIs range from a small UBI with low income tax rates on low incomes, to a high UBI with increased taxes, quantitative easing, or means testing. This motion locates GPEW policy in the middle of the range, and includes the cost of a basic amount of energy.

Delete policies EC724-EC725, EC734 and EC800-803.
Replace EC730-EC733 with:

EC730 A Universal Basic Income will be introduced. The UBI will be an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable to each individual as a right of legal residence in the UK. It will not be subject to means testing and there will be no requirement to be either working or actively seeking work.

EC731 Housing, disability, and child benefits will be reinstated or retained as separate conditional benefits.

EC732 With a UBI there are no means tests. They will be partially replaced by increasing income tax rates at the lower end of the tax scale, so that the tax rates there are equal to the top rate of tax on high incomes.

EC733 The UBI should be equal to the basic cost of living, including the cost of a basic energy allowance, updated frequently if necessary.

## Synopsis
In most cases in the Policies for a Sustainable Society, gender neutral language is used, however on a handful of occasions gendered pronouns have been used. This motion addresses these instances while making no material changes to the policies in question.

## Motion
Changes to replace gendered language with gender neutral language throughout the Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS) affecting the Crime and Justice, Education, Migration, Public Administration, and Social Welfare chapters

CJ206 currently reads:
“CJ206 To ensure that if an offender has to be detained, the purpose of detention is not to punish humiliate or degrade him/her, but to protect society or the offender her/himself, while maintaining his/her dignity and human rights.”
Replace “him/her” with “them”, replace “her/himself” with “themselves”, and replace “his/her” with “their”, so that it reads:

“CJ206 To ensure that if an offender has to be detained, the purpose of detention is not to punish humiliate or degrade them, but to protect society or the offender themselves, while maintaining their dignity and human rights.”

CJ372 currently reads:
“CJ372 Only the Crown Court will have the power to order detention and only when it is satisfied that the public must be protected because there is a substantial risk of a further grave crime, or that the offences have caused such public alarm that the offenders presence in the community would constitute a threat to his/her own safety.”
Replace “his/her” with “their” so that it reads:

“CJ372 Only the Crown Court will have the power to order detention and only when it is satisfied that the public must be protected because there is a substantial risk of a further grave crime, or that the offences have caused such public alarm that the offenders presence in the community would constitute a threat to their own safety.”

CJ374 currently reads:
“CJ374 Prisoners will be granted the right to vote. Any decision to deny a prisoner the vote will be taken only by a judge, taking into account the particular circumstances of his/her case.”
Replace “his/her” with “their” so that it reads:

“CJ374 Prisoners will be granted the right to vote. Any decision to deny a prisoner the vote will be taken only by a judge, taking into account the particular circumstances of their case.”

CJ500, point iv. b currently reads:
“The cost of medical and psychological tests must be borne by the applicant, together with a new annual fee which is sufficient to repay the economic damage - to police, court and NHS - inflicted on it by the abuse of guns generally. When licences are awarded the onus will be on the applicant to demonstrate his or her suitability to handle firearms rather than on the authorities to prove the applicant's unsuitability. Licence holders will be required to renew their applications on an annual basis individuals whose licence application is rejected will be required to wait at least two years before re-applying.”
Replace “his or her” with “their” so that it reads:

ED165 currently reads:
“ED165 Every disabled learner will have an entitlement to an assessment of his / her learning needs. This will identify equipment and facilities required, curriculum differentiation and learning styles, and any educational professional and personal assistance that is needed”

MG401 currently reads:
“MG401 We will allow the partners, prospective partners, immediate families and prospective families of British residents to join them without excessive delays or unreasonable requirements for proof of relationship. This will be independent of the financial status of the resident and will not be dependent on her/him providing accommodation (We recognise that this must be implemented in association with a housing policy).”
Replace “her/him” with “them” so that it reads:

PA387 currently reads:
“PA387 Directly elected individual positions. Electing a single individual to a position of power, as with Metropolitan mayors and Police and Crime Commissioners, puts sole power in the hands of one person representing his or her own viewpoint or that of a single political party. This is at best democratically suspect, especially where that position is not subject to wider and representative accountability: the Green Party believes it is neither appropriate nor in keeping with other Green Party policy. However, while these posts continue to exist, the Green Party will continue to stand candidates for them whilst also arguing and working for their abolition or reform. Furthermore, we believe that the present £5000 deposits required for these elections are an unnecessary and unreasonable barrier to democratic participation, and should be replaced by a requirement for an increased number of nominating signatures.”

PA452 currently reads:
“PA452 Over the years the power of the Prime Minister in particular has greatly increased. Not only does the Prime Minister exercise the remaining elements of the royal prerogative in making vital decisions like war and peace and having effective control of the armed forces, but his or her powers of patronage - in particular choosing the members of the government - give the Prime Minister overwhelming control of both the overall direction and the minutiae of government. Reflecting the powers of Prime Ministers, general elections have come to resemble presidential contests, with the characters of the leaders of the main political parties coming under more intense scrutiny than their policies.”

It is a time of change with Green World and GWEB.

GW has been run for many years by Resource Media.
 
But the party's Executive has made the difficult decision of bringing GW in house. It will now be located on the Party's main website. This will take place from October. Up till that point it will be run by RM.

GWEB would like to thank RM for their outstanding work over the years â€“ they have always been a pleasure to work with. I'm sure everyone in GPEW wishes them well for the future.

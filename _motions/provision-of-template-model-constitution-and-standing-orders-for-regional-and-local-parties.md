## Synopsis

There is a wide variety of Constitutions and Standing Orders in use by Regional and Local Parties. This results in:

* Inconsistencies with Green Party principles;
* Lack of clarity as to how to manage local and regional parties e.g. run meetings (including managing motions), manage officer elections etc.;
* Lack of clarity as to how local parties relate to regions and how regions relate to the central party and its governance bodies
* Lack of clarity as to whether/how local and regional parties can/should influence GPEW policy and should make local/regional policy (e.g. for the London Assembly);
* Wasted energy and de-motivation as local party officers unintentionally make mistakes and/or have to re-invent drafting, processes etc.

Note that:

* The Green Party Regional Council has been selected to be tasked with this work in accordance with clause 6 (iii) of the Constitution of the Green Party of England and Wales.
* Due to the different constitutional status of the Wales Green Party, it is not in scope of this motion.

## Motion

The Green Party Regional Council will organise the development of a template/model Constitution and Standing Orders for Local Parties and a template/model Constitution and Standing Orders for Regional Parties, setting out good practice for:

* Managing internal party business (including but not limited to: meeting types and frequency, who can call an EGM, quorum rules, voting rights, processes for motions, processes for officer elections both annually and for casual vacancies etc.)
* Scope of, and relationships between, the local, regional and central parties (including but not limited to: scope to set policy and set organisational rules, rules for regionally elected national roles such as Green Party Regional Council Representatives such as their accountability to the region and the process to remove an incumbent etc.)
* Use of standardised terms across the governance of the party, each defined and (where relevant) cross-referencing to other governance documents.

The template/model Constitutions, Standing Orders and Defined Terms are not mandatory, and local and regional parties will be free to adopt/amend as they see fit, but together they will provide a clear guide on the minimum expectations and requirements of a local party to be consistent with Green Party of England and Walesâ€™s Constitution, and a local or regional party can choose to adopt them as written knowing they will enable a party to operate responsibly and effectively.

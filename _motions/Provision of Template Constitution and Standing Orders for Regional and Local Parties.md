## Synopsis
There is a wide variety of Constitutions and Standing Orders in use by Regional and Local Parties. This results in:

* Inconsistencies with Green Party principles;
* Lack of clarity as to how to e.g. run meetings (including managing motions), manage officer elections etc.;
* Lack of clarity as to how local parties

This synopsis has been truncated to meet the word limit.

## Motion
The Green Party of England and Wales will develop a template Constitution and Standing Orders for Local and Regional Parties, setting out good practice for:

* Managing internal party business (meetings, officer elections etc.)
* Scope of, and relationships between, the local, regional and central parties (including scope to set policy and set organisational rules)

The template Constitution and Standing Orders will be primarily for guidance and local and regional parties will be free to adopt/amend as they see fit, but it will highlight the de minimis required for a local or regional party to be consistent with the GPEW constitution.

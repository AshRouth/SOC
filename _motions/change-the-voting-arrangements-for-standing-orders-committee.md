## Synopsis

At the moment, SOC voting happens at conference and is limited to those there during the relevant hours between Saturday and Sunday. There is no prior notice of candidates, and statements are often short and scrappy. This is profoundly undemocratic - just a few hundred voters out of 50,000 members elect members to very important roles. We will be proposing a motion to move elections to SOC through an appropriate and professional process as part of the annual internal elections.

## Synopsis

The number one aim of this party is to “develop and implement policies”, and this party is proud to have a members led policy process. Therefore all of the party’s policy process should clearly be defined in one place and other governance documents should reference this one place.

## Motion

Delete section of the current constitution entitled “Policy Making” and replace with section outlined below title “Policy section to be inserted into the constitution”.

In line with point (7) added to constitution by the previous sentence, create a standing orders document entitled “Standing Orders for the Policy Process” and insert the text below which starts with title “The Policy Process” and ends with “[END OF POLICY PROCESS DOCUMENT]”.

Make the changes laid out below title “Changes to other parts of the constitution required to ensure consistency” up until “[END OF CONSISTENCY CHANGES]”

Conference instructs the Policy Development Coordinator, with the support of Policy Development Committee and Green Party Executive to make the following change to the party’s policies to bring them inline with changes this motion makes:

•	-	Keep the current ‘Philosophical Basis’  unchanged. Keep the current ‘Policies for a Sustainable Society’ unchanged on the party’s public facing website, but inline with point 6) in part A of the new “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”, also published them on website only accessible to members along with the following for each chapter:

•	◦	Revision log (starting from changes made at spring 2021 conference)

•	◦	Background paper (if existing background paper cannot be found then a blank place holder should be published reminding members that one needs writing).

•	-	Take the current contents of Record of Policy Statements (RoPS) and split into Policy Statements in accordance with points 7) to 14) in Part A of “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”. The Party’s manifestos published since 2010 should be included as policy statements, and all but the most recent will be set as “inactive”. All of the other policy statements currently in RoPS will initially be ‘active’. Policy Development Committee will decide on initial expiry dates for all ‘active’ policy statements. These will be dates between 1 and 5 years time and will be included in the members facing publication of policy statements. Once this has happened and ‘active Policy statements’ have been published on the party’s external website and all policy statement are on the members website, remove RoPS from party’s website.

Standing Orders Committee (SOC) is empowered to make further changes to the constitution (and any Standing Orders this motion is being applied to) that are necessary to ensure that they are consistent with the contents of “Policy section to be inserted into constitution” and “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”  document this motion introduces.
Where relevant ‘#’ in the next text added by this motion should be replaces with appropriate section numbers and the remainder of documents should be renumber as needed. SOC are empowered to ensure “Standing Orders for the Policy Process” is formatted for accessibility and clarity.

Policy section to be inserted into the constitution

 # Policy

1	Green Party Policy is defined by:

•	◦	Philosophical Basis

•	◦	Policies for a Sustainable Society

•	◦	Policy Statements

2	The Philosophical Basis outlines the party’s broad policy approach and all other Green Party policies must be consistent with the Philosophical Basis.


3	The Philosophical Basis of the Party may be changed only by a two-thirds majority at Conference, or by a two thirds majority vote of the membership through a party-wide ballot.


4	Policies for a Sustainable Society may be amended; new Policy Statements may be added and existing ones amended, by a majority vote at Conference, as outlined in the Standing Orders for Conduct of Conference and ‘Standing Orders for the Policy Process’.


5	The Green Party Regional Council can approve additional Policy Statements or amend existing policy statements between conferences providing that resulting Policy Statements are consistent with Policies for a Sustainable Society. These policy statement become inactive at the end of the next conference unless conference votes to keep them active and sets a new expiry date. In exceptional circumstance, where rapidly changing political circumstance mean it is not possible to respond to changing events in a way that is consistent with both Philosophical Basis and Policies for a Sustainable Society, the Policy statements don’t have to be consistent with all of Policies for a Sustainable Society.


6	The membership of the party shall be primarily responsible for the formulation of policy which they then approve via conference. To do this they can form Policy Working Groups or a Policy Network which the Policy Development Committee can recognise and support.


7	The ‘Standing Orders for the Policy Process’ document will define the processes for the development, drafting, formatting, presenting, approving, reviewing, amending and deleting/archiving party policy. This document shall be a single place, where all rules and procedures relating to party policy process shall be found and shall be referenced by standing orders for party bodies where relevant to their function. These standing orders for party policy can only be amended by a simple majority of conference.


8	There shall be a Policy Development Committee which shall be convened by the Policy Development Co-ordinator. The ‘Standing Orders for Policy Development Committee’ document will clarify the committees role, processes and procedures. The Policy Development Committee shall include five members elected by ballot of the entire membership. Up to an additional five non-voting members may be co-opted by the elected Committee. This co-option shall take place after an annual skills audit carried out immediately following the election of the elected members, and will take account of:


8.1	the views of Equality and Diversity Committee


8.2	the views of relevant special interest groups within the party


8.3	views of the Association of Green Councillors,

The Philosophical Basis

2	As set out in ‘# Policy’ section of constitution:

2.1	The party’s broad policy approach is laid out in the “Philosophical Basis”.

2.2	All other Green Party policy, as laid out below must be consistent with the Philosophical Basis.

3	The Philosophical Basis shall be published on the party’s public facing website. It shall also be published on the members website along with a revision log.

Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS)

4	Policies for a Sustainable Society is the Party’s democratically agreed set of policies which together layout the key specific changes the party wants to enact. These shall be made up of a set number of defined chapters each covering a specific area of policy. Each chapter shall:

4.2	Provide a clear and precise framework, which shows how the party approaches each area of governance.
4.3	Where relevant outline Local Government policies.

4.4	Not contain excessive policy detail, short-term policies, or responses to contemporary political issues.

4.9	It shall be written in plain English.

4.10	It shall not encroach unnecessarily upon other chapters of Policies for a Sustainable Society, but should cross-reference where appropriate.

5	Policies for a Sustainable Society should aim to provide the party’s Leaders, Spokespeople, candidates and activists/campaigners with a comprehensive yet concise set of policy approaches for communication with the electorate and wider public. These in combination with the Philosophical Basis (PB) and Policy Statements should support them in robustly answering questions on all major policy areas.

6	Each Policies for a Sustainable Society chapter will be published on the members website along with its revision log and its Background Paper.


Policy Statements


7	Policy Statements as distinct from Policies for a Sustainable Society and Philosophical Basis express party policy for a limited period of time.

8	All Policy Statements will either be classed as active, or inactive and have an expiry date where they automatically become inactive. This date may not exceed ten years from when the statement is passed.

9	New or amended Policy Statements must not contradict Policies for a Sustainable Society, or existing active Policy Statements

10	Active Policy Statements will be published in the Party’s public-facing website. All Policy Statements will be published on the members’ website in date order along with their expiry dates, active/inactive status, and date and body which last amended them.

11	New Policy Statements will comply with either ‘Letters and Statements’, ‘Published Summaries’ or ‘Manifestos’ categories detailed below.

12	Letters and Statements

12.1	These Policy Statements either take the form of formal letters to officials or organisations, or brief statements of fact and/or belief on behalf of the Party.

12.2	These should clarify the party’s stance on a particular issue(s), call on another organisation or group to act in a particular way, clarify how our Philosophical Basis and Policies for a Sustainable Society should be interpreted in a certain context.

12.3	They should be clear, concise and in appropriate language for a general audience.

12.4	They should not contain reference to structures or processes of the party

12.5	They may contain appropriately formatted references to evidence, petitions or other relevant information or organisations.

12.6	The text of these will be included as a Policy Statement on the party’s website in accordance to active, inactive criteria, but they may also be published in other forms (e.g. Press releases, as a printed letter) which can include other non-policy related content.

13	Published Summaries

13.1	These are documents which presents the Party’s policy on a particular theme or topic, or to a particular group or audience.

13.2	They are published by the party in a way compliant with party’s branding guidelines but appropriate to the summary’s purpose. A working link to a version of the summary will be included as a Policy Statement on party’s website in accordance to active, inactive criteria.

14	Manifestos

14.1	These layout out specific proposals relevant to powers and term length of those being elected. These proposals should present a comprehensive plan for how the body in question, over the period in question, should work towards objectives laid out in Policies for a Sustainable Society & Philosophical Basis.

14.2	The Party may publish manifestos in the run up to elections.

14.2.a	They are published by the party in a way compliant with party’s branding guidelines, and appropriate for a manifesto at that time. A working link to a version of the manifesto will be include as a Policy Statement on website in accordance to active, inactive criteria.

14.3	Local, regional and national parties as well as federations of these may also publish Manifestos for elections they are responsible for co-ordinating. These do not class a policy statements of ‘The Green Party of England and Wales’, so although they must be consistent with Philosophical Basis, Policies for a Sustainable Society & active Policy Statements they do not have to follow process outline in this document.

Delete contents of “APPENDIX 1: GPRC’s Role in GPEW Policy, including the procedure for Developing and Approving Policy Statements” of Green Party Regional Council’s Standing Orders and replace with:
Green Party Regional Council (GPRC) has a significant role in relation to the policy of GPEW, particularly in relation to ‘Policy Statements’ (which includes Manifestos). This is detailed in the Standing Orders for the Policy Process (see sections 18 to 20 of Part B). Below is some useful background and notes in relations to this.


1.Definition of Party Policy


1.1 As outlined in Part A, points 7-14 of “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”, Policy Statements express party policy for a limited period of time. They take one of 3 forms:
⁃	Letters and Statements
⁃	Published Summaries
⁃	Manifestos


1.2 Between conferences policy statements may be agreed by GPRC in accordance to rules layout out in the “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”. These then remain active policy statement until the next conference when they are reviewed.


2.0 Initiating and Drafting New Policy Statements


2.1 The initiator of the request for a Policy Statement should appoint somebody from within their own ranks to "lead" on the project. This could be any elected party body or local/regional party, affiliated group or working group. It shall be that person's responsibility for ensuring that the Policy Statement is prepared and submitted to GPRC.


2.2 GPRC should encourage the project leader to immediately inform the Policy Development Committee  (via the Policy Development Coordinator) and any relevant Policy Working Groups (or Policy Network) that they wish to produce the Policy Statement on a particular subject.


2.3 It is the project leader's responsibility to find somebody to draft the proposal, or to undertake to draft it themselves if they prefer.


3 GPRC Policy Statements Approval Sub-Committee


3.1 GPRC shall elect a Policy Statement Approval Sub-Committee of three members from within its ranks, one of whom will be the GPRC Friend to the GPEX Policy Development Coordinator.


3.2 The role of the Policy Statement Approval Sub-Committee shall be to consider in detail any proposed New Policy Statements or amendment to existing Policy Statement prior to consideration by GPRC as a whole (at Meeting or via email).


3.3 Copies of the proposal shall be circulated to the Policy Statements Approval Sub-Committee members for consideration as soon as it has been prepared. The Approval Sub-Committee members shall discuss the proposed Policy Statement with its initiator/s, project leader, Policy Development Co-ordinator and appropriate Policy Working Groups (or Policy Network) as they see fit.


4 Approval of Policy Statements by GPRC


4.1 The Approval Sub-Committee shall ensure that the proposed Policy Statement is submitted to the next full GPRC meeting agenda along with a recommendation drawn from option laid out in Part B point 20 of the “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”. [Amendment 6: Insert “If they Approval Sub-Committee deem consideration of proposed Policy Statement so urgent that it can’t wait until the next GPRC meeting (for instance because it relates to just announced result of a referendum), it can be circulated for consideration and vote on approval by email.”]


4.2 The Policy Statements Approval Sub-Committee's views shall be taken into consideration by GPRC, but shall not be binding upon GPRC when making its final decision.


4.3 The full list of option available to GPRC in responding to request to approve New Policy Statements are laid out in Part B point 20 of the “Standing Orders for the Policy Process”. Part B point 18 of the “Standing Orders for the Policy Process” lays out GPRC powers to amend existing policy statements (for instance on request from Policy Development Committee or Political Committee)


4.4 The Approval Sub-Committee shall keep a record of GPRC decisions relating to Policy Statements and inform the Policy Development Co-ordinator of them so they can be included in Policy Development Committee Policy Update report to the next conference.


5.Election manifestos


5.1	Election manifestos created for the national party take two forms – the main manifesto and mini-manifestos (also sometimes known as specialist manifestos).


5.2	As outlined in Part B point 20 of the “Standing Orders for the Policy Process” a working group will be setup by Policy Development Committee to produce manifesto.  As well as membership outlined in Standing Orders for the Policy Process, key staff members, such as the Head of Elections and Head of Communications, a representative of the parliamentary office and a representative of policy staff may also be involved in this the group.

5.3	It is important to note that professional designers, copyeditors and proof readers will work on the manifesto text *after* approval by GPRC, but no additional content should be added. GPRC’s sole responsibility in this regard is to discuss and approve (or reject) extensions and elaborations of existing policy that are proposed in the text, and not to take a view on style and presentation.


5.4	Wherever possible the final, approved manifesto will be presented in a range of formats, such as Welsh (and possibly other languages used in England and Wales), British Sign Language, Braille and Easy Read (a format aimed at people with Learning Disabilities). There is no expectation on GPRC members to approve these formats.  


5.5	Similarly, mini-manifestos are generated within liberation/inclusion groups and special interest groups. There is currently no fixed process for commissioning these texts, nor a standard length or format. As Part B point 20.3 of “Standing Orders for the Policy Process” outlines, GPRC are expected to sign off these texts in relation to political policy content only, but this doesn’t require a full vote a GPRC. These texts are often generated at quite short notice close to polling day, so their sign-off is usually delegated to the Policy Statements Approval Sub-Committee as urgent work.    


6.Advisory Papers


6.1 One of GPRC’s functions is to ‘help and advise’ GPEX. The Leaders, National Spokespeople and Press Officers may ask for 'help and advice’ on the matter of a policy position. GPRC can drawn on the knowledge/experience of Policy Development Committee or Policy Network in responding to such request or delegate task as appropriate.

As outlined on the “New Policy Process” GP Space and discussed at past Conferences and Policy Fests, there are a range of issues with the current policy process as well as many strengths. The implementation of the output of these discussions has been on hold for a number of years as we were waiting on clarity as to what constitution we should be amending. The Extraordinary Conference gave an opportunity to bring forwards these changes however because it failed to reach quoracy the proposals weren’t discussed. Since May 2021 more consultation on this proposal have taken place so a refined version is being put to Spring 2022 conference.


This motion is to amend the party’s constitution. This motion aims to make the minimum changes to policy process where there is most consensus. That said the motion does make quite big changes to how the policy process is presented and defined. The principle aim is to improve clarity and accessibility of the process and reduce the scope for multiple interpretation.

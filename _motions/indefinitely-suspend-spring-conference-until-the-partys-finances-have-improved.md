## M﻿otion

*This motion would commit the Green Party to not hold an in-person Spring Conference until doing so would be more affordable. It also opens the possibility of holding a longer Autumn Conference to help compensate for this.*

Conference notes that the Green Party currently holds two annual conferences, one in the spring and one in the autumn. These are expensive events to run and generally cost the party more than is received in ticket income.

Conference notes that there is variation among UK political parties on how many times a year they hold conferences.

Confernece acknowledges that given the present economic climate in the UK and the financial pressures experienced by the Party, it does not make financial sense to hold two of these events when the functions of one could be carried out online.

Conference instructs GPEX to indefinitely suspend Spring Conference until such a time as the party’s financial situation has improved to such a standard that to hold a Spring Conference would not be of significant financial detriment to the party. GPEX should report back on this situation at the Autumn 2025 Conference.

Conference further instructs GPEX to investigate whether a four-day Autumn Conference might, given the above, make financial sense - given the economies of scale of holding one, larger event. Additionally, Conference notes that a single, longer conference may attract more members and therefore more revenue from ticket income.

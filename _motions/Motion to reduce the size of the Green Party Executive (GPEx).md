This motion calls on conference to amend Clause 7 of the constitution by deleting the existing Clause 7 and replacing it with the following:

7.	GREEN PARTY EXECUTIVE

i)	There shall be a Green Party Executive (hereinafter referred to as the Party Executive or GPEx) which shall be responsible for the overall and day-to-day direction of the Party. Certain duties and responsibilities are reserved to other Party bodies specified in this Constitution, in particular Conference, Standing Orders Committee, Green Party Regional Council, Disciplinary Committee, Appeals Committee and Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee. The authority of the Executive does not extend over those reserved duties and responsibilities.

ii)	The Party Executive shall consist of the following voting members: Leader plus Deputy Leader(s) or Co-Leaders, Wales Green Party Leader, the two co-chairs of the Young Greens as a job share and the additional members elected to the following functional positions, to serve for two years:
a)	Chair;
b)	Treasurer;
c)	Seven ordinary members.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) will be a non-voting member of the Executive.

iii)	Elections for the GPEx Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary member posts shall be by a ballot of all members of the party with voting included within the Annual Ballot.  The Chair and Treasurer shall be elected in one year in individual ballots by instant run off, at the same time as the Leader(s) plus Deputy Leader(s), and the ordinary members in the next year by a seven-seat single transferable vote, so that the two-year terms of the two groups are staggered.

Any such sub-committee shall include at least one member of the Regional Council.
 
xi)	The Party Executive shall appoint the following posts:
a)	a National Election Agent;
b)	The Party Executive shall nominate persons to Spokesperson roles, who shall each be responsible for covering a designated area of policy. They shall be appointed subject to ratification by the Green Party Regional Council, who may approve or reject any nomination. The Regional Council may recall any appointed Spokesperson. The Young Greens Co-Chairs shall be the Youth and Students Spokespeople.
~~c)	In addition the Party Executive may create such posts as it considers necessary.~~

xii)	The Executive shall elect from among its elected members a deputy chair, to assist the chair in their duties, and to act in the role of the chair at any time when the chair is unable to do so. Such elections are to take place at least annually and by the end of November each year.

xiv)	In the event of 20% of constituted Local Parties petitioning the Regional Council to recall the GPEx Chair, Treasurer or Ordinary Member, such a member shall be under suspension until a new ballot has been held for that post at a date to be determined by the Regional Council.

xv)	In the event of a casual vacancy (i.e. one not arising in the normal electoral cycle) for a GPEx Chair, Treasurer or Ordinary Member position a replacement shall be appointed in an acting capacity by the Party Executive until the next scheduled ballot is held.

Conference notes that a document claiming to be “**Guidance on the Equality Act 2010 – gender reassignment and gender critical beliefs”** has been published in a blog article today [ https://thecritic.co.uk/it-isnt-easy-being-a-gender-critical-green/](https://thecritic.co.uk/it-isnt-easy-being-a-gender-critical-green/)

Conference requests GPEx to confirm or deny whether the published Legal Advice has indeed been received.\

If the Party has received the above legal advice, Conference requests GPEx and GPRC to ensure it is made available to all Party members in order to protect the Party and its local and regional bodies from the risk of unknowingly acting illegally by engaging in any actions that might constitute illegal discrimination.

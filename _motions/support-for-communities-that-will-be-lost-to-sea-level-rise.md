## Synopsis

With the world already passing 1.2º C of warming, climate change adaptation measures are increasingly going to be needed, and these need to be delivered in a socially just way. One aspect which needs to be addressed are properties at risk of flooding due to rising sea levels:

* While major towns and cities will likely be protected by enhanced flood defences, for many smaller communities face being abandoned to rising sea levels, e.g. 200,000 properties in England alone may have to be abandoned due to rising sea levels by 2050 ([ https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61795783](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61795783));
* Currently, at-risk communities have no clarity as to which might be abandoned, by when, and what assistance will be provided to those who will lose their homes and businesses (e.g. [ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees)).

## Motion

The Green Party of England and Wales will ensure that where a community has to be lost to sea-level rise:

* All individuals and businesses that have been in place for at least 5 years prior to the date of the decision will be provided with the necessary support (financial and non-financial) to re-locate them to an otherwise equivalent location that is not threatened by rising sea levels.
* Communities that are impacted by the re-location of displaced individuals and businesses will also be provided with the necessary support (financial and non-financial) to manage the re-location, such as to provide additional amenities and infrastructure.
* The process for re-location will be consultative and community-led, involving both the community being lost to sea-level rise and the communities potentially and actually impacted by re-location, and will ensure a fair outcome for all those affected.

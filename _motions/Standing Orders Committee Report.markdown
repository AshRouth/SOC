## Motion Text
To accept the following report (as amended, if amendments are agreed) and fast-tracking recommendations (as amended, if amendments are agreed).

Under Standing Orders, the SOC Report is to include: "(1) The Final Agenda and Ordering of Motions for Conference; (2) a notification of how many motions and amendments have been ruled out of order and where these are published; (3) a report on SOC’s participation in the Agenda process including any motions or amendments that SOC is submitting to conference; (4) timetabling, chairing and other procedural matters affecting conference including elections to be held at conference, with the recommendations of SOC; (5) the report of the RO; (6) a report by SOC of any changes that they have adopted to their Standing Orders; (7) progress on Organisational Statements; (8) any other matters or recommendations that do not affect the running of conference; (9) rulings requested and made since the previous conference."

### 1. The Final Agenda and Ordering of Motions for Conference

Please report any errors found in the Final Agenda to soc@greenparty.org.uk.

The Green Party develop the vast majority of our policy by way of Voting Papers for chapters of policy in Policies for a Sustainable Society, as prepared by a Working Group following an Enabling Motion. These come to Conference either as B motions (for voting) or F motions (for discussion) for part or whole chapters of policies containing many detailed policies. Small changes to chapters can be made by C motions, which are accredited by Policy Development Committee (PDC) as having met the basic Standing Orders requirements for consultation. E motions are unaccredited motions which have usually not met the Standing Order requirements for consultation or for gaining consensus within the Party, but Section E also includes Enabling Motions.

SOC held our First Agenda meeting on Zoom on 18th
December 2021. The order of policy motions in sections F
and C was pre-discussed at a routine SOC meeting with a
member of Policy Development Committee (PDC) and
agreed at a series of meetings discussing the Final Agenda on 23rd and 30th January 2022 when PDC also made
recommendations on fast-tracking of policy motions. The
order of these motions is given below. These were agreed
by SOC on the 6th February 2022.
The motions proposed in the Final Agenda for this Annual
General Meeting and Conference are:

#### Section A Reports

Under section 10(ii)(a) of the Constitution, Spring
Conference requires A Reports only from Standing Orders
Committee (SOC), Policy Development Committee (PDC)
and Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee (ADRC). The
report from ADRC was submitted in advance of the First
Agenda deadline, and the remaining relevant groups and
committees submitted their reports in advance of the Final
Agenda Deadline on the 28th of January 2022.

Amendments to motions A01 and A02 can be made from
the floor of Conference.

The order was determined on past practice and is as in the
First Agenda. The Prioritisation Ballot for motions does not
apply to Section A. Under Standing Orders for Conduct of
Conference (SOCC) F1c) “The ballot shall not be used to
prioritise items within Section A of the Agenda since these
should all be considered.”

#### Section B Voting Papers on Chapters of Policies for a Sustainable Society:

No such motions have been brought to this Conference.

#### Section C Accredited Policy Motions

These policy motions were accredited after the First
Agenda stage and had been listed as E motions in the
Prioritisation Ballot. Accreditation by Policy Development
Committee (PDC) does not accredit the policy content. It
means that PDC has checked that the motion was
adequately researched and consulted on and not in conflict
with other policies passed in the last two years. The
motions concern: addressing this government’s failure to
support young refugees; petitioning the government to halt
HS2 works damaging an aquifer; and eliminating fossil fuel
assets from the financial sector.

#### Amendments to Section C

No amendments have been proposed to any of the C
section motions.

The order of Section C as agreed with Policy Development
Committee is:

| First Agenda | Final Agenda |
| E05 | C01 |
| OoO1 | CO2 |
| E12 | C03 |

#### Section D Organisational motions

We accepted 15 organisational motions.

#### Amendments to Section D

There have been 20 proposed amendments to motions in
section D, of which we ruled 4 out of order and have
proposed that 2 be basketed together.

The ranking is as in the Prioritisation Ballot, except for D01,
in relation to which we exercised our discretion under
Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference, paragraph
F2.6(c), to give special priority to any motion in section D
which we consider to be urgent for the functioning of the
party or any part of it.

| First Agenda | Ballot Agenda | Final |
| D01 | 1 | D01 |
| D10 | 2 | D02 |
| D02 | 3 | D03 |
| D05 | 4 | D04 |
| D03 | 5 | D05 |
| D04 | 6 | D06 |
| D13 | 7 | D07 |
| D15 | 8 | D08 |
| D14 | 9 | D09 |
| D09 | 10 | D10 |
| D11 | 11 | D11 |
| D07 | 12 | D12 |
| D08 | 13 | D13 |
| D06 | 14 | D14 |
| D12 | 15 | D15 |

#### Section E Unaccredited Policy Motions

We accepted 17 policy motions in section E.

#### Amendments to Section E

There were 7 proposed amendments to motions in section
E, of which we ruled 1 out of order.


Order of motions: We have moved First Agenda motions
OoO1, E12 and E05 to section C, accredited policy motions.
The remaining motions are ordered according to the
Prioritisation Ballot.

| First Agenda | Ballot Rank | Final Agenda |
| E14 | 1 | E01 |
| E07 | 2 | E02 |
| E02 | 3 | E03 |
| E03 | 4 | E04 |
| E01 | 5 | E05 |
| E15 | 6 | E06 |
| E11 | 7 | E07 |
| E06 | 8 | E08 |
| E04 | 9 | E09 |
| E18 | 10 | E10 |
| E10 | 11 | E11 |
| E16 | 12 | E12 |
| E17 | 13 | E13 |
| E08 | 14 | E14 |
| E13 | 15 | E15 |
| E09 | 16 | E16 |
| OoO3 | 17 | E17 |

#### Section F Draft Voting Papers for revising substantial parts of PSS.

There is a single Draft Voting Paper in section F to be given
a workshop at Conference ready for progression to the B
motion stage, concerning revisions to the Land Use Chapter
of Policies for a Sustainable Society (PfSS). Amendments
have been proposed and included in the interests of
facilitating debate and highlighting areas for discussion

#### Compositing

No motions were composited.

#### Late Motions

The Late Motions Forum was open from the 20th December
2021 to 11th February 2022 at
https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/spring-2022-late-
motion-forum/ for items that could not have been
submitted by the 17th December 2021 because they related
to events taking place since then. Standing Orders for the
Conduct of Conference does not require late motions to be
part of the Final Agenda.

We received one late motion which we have been able to
include in the Final Agenda.

#### Emergency Motions (EMs)

We opened the Emergency Motions Forum on 11th February
2022, these are not part of the Final Agenda.

#### Summaries and synopses

Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC)
states that all motions must have a synopsis of not more
than 50 words, or 300 for a policy paper. In practice we do
not reject motions without a synopsis although we reserve
the right to do so. We cut overlong synopses at 50 words
and note that this has happened.


#### Background Information

Where provided, we link to background information below
the motion. SOCC requires background information to be in
notes, not in the motion itself. Where background
information is given in the submitted motion, we may
remove it to a note.

### 2. A notification of how many motions
Following the First Agenda meeting, 3 motions were found
to be Out of Order, with reasons given. A further policy
motion, which became motion C02, was initially thought by
SOC to be Out of Order as proposing significant changes to
policy but without having passed through the agreed
process of consultation. Following consultation with Policy
Development Committee (PDC), we came to the view that
this was an error on our part, and this motion had in fact
never been Out of Order.

Concerning those motions found to be Out of Order, all
proposers were contacted following the First Agenda
meeting with suggestions as to how their motions could be
amended back into order. Proposers for one motion, which
became motion E17, made such amendments as we felt
were necessary to recommend to Conference that this
motion be ruled back in order as part of the Final Agenda,
using our discretion under SOCC E7.3. We also decided to use our discretion under SOCC F1, concerning the running of the Prioritisation Ballot, to include this motion in the
Prioritisation Ballot so as to provide a guide on where to
recommend it be placed in the Final Agenda, were
Conference minded to accept its recommendation. The
process of putting together the Prioritisation Ballot is
outlined further below.

### 3. A report on SOC’s participation in the Agenda process including any motions or amendments that SOC is submitting to conference

SOC and staff opened the Agenda Forum shortly following
the end of Autumn Conference 2021 in Greenspaces at
https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/spring-conference-
2022-agenda-forum/ and a calendar of deadlines was
posted there. We sent an email to all Party members to say
that it had opened.

There was something of a delay in the handover between
the previous and current incarnations of SOC owing to
difficulties in running the relevant ballots at the Autumn
Conference 2021. This meant that several of the ballots,
including for the election of SOC, had to be run again. The
current incarnation of SOC were informed of the results by
email on the 9th November 2021.

Additionally, to avoid creating work for volunteers or staff
over the Christmas/Holiday period, the Pre-Agenda and
First Agenda deadlines were brought forward by several
weeks to 3rd and 17th December 2021 respectively. This
created something of a ‘squeeze’ period for the newly-
constituted SOC. We worked to ameliorate this through
maintaining regular, general meetings to manage workflow
on a fortnightly basis.

In addition to logging motions on the members’ website
using the Stream on the forum, SOC endeavoured to make
the process of submitting motions easier for this
Conference. We did so by using a separate website logging
proposed motions and providing links to a more accessible
online form. In the preparation and refinement of this we
are grateful to Conferences Committee and to our GPEx
Equality and Diversity Coordinator. This allowed members
to propose motions other than by emailing SOC and was
more efficient. We added the submission form to the
Agenda Forum on December 9th, 2021, slightly later than
was initially hoped, but SOC continued to accept
submissions of proposed motions by email during this
period.

First Agenda preparation requires a large time commitment
which is aggravated by members of the Party submitting
reports and motions with complex formatting or as
images. The use of a webform instead of email reduces the
amount of reformatting needed. There were teething issues
- we had new technology to get used to, and numbers of co-proposers were not updated live but required manual
work by volunteers. We nevertheless hope that the use of
this form and website for this Conference represented a
step in the right direction in facilitating the participation of
members in Conference business. We aim to build on this
model and make additional improvements in time for the
Autumn 2022 Conference.

While party members had entered just over 40 possible
motions on the website by the time of the First Agenda
deadline, we did have to make decisions about which of the
motions on the Stream were appropriately formatted in line
with the published guidelines. Some motions were only
shared in their final form a few hours before the deadline,
creating a sizeable amount of additional work for
Committee members. We urge members to place items on
the Agenda Forum at an early stage so that they can
consult, revise wording, obtain supporting co-proposers or
support from a local party or working group. For policy
motions, we advise you to obtain accreditation from Policy
Development Committee. SOC will be mindful of this in
considering how we might propose revisions of the
Standing Orders for Conduct of Conference (SOCC) in future
to allow for a more efficient use of time.

SOC placed several items on the Pre-Agenda forum which
became motions in the Final Agenda. These are entitled:

• Amendment to constitution proposed by Standing
Orders Committee (this removes constitutional
ambiguity regarding leadership terms);
• Constitutional amendments clarifying the role of
‘re-open nominations’ (RON);
• Including remote attendance in quorum for
Conference;
• Regulating the distribution of campaign literature
at Conference.

The First Agenda meeting of Standing Orders Committee
was held on 18th December 2021. Motions were ordered
ready for the Prioritisation Ballot according to the rules
given in Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference.
We opened the Amendment Forum and the Late Motions
Forum in good time in Green Spaces on 20th December
2021 at https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/spring-2022-
amendment-forum/ and
https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/spring-2022-late-
motion-forum/ with links placed in the Agenda Forum.

#### The Prioritisation Ballot

There were no C motions for the Prioritisation Ballot,
notwithstanding that Policy Development Committee had
been able to consider accreditations. The order of these
motions was decided in consultation with PDC at an SOC
meeting of 6th February 2022.

Owing to the removal of three motions from the ballot for E
motions due to their being accredited, and consequently
different numbering for the motions on the ballot and on the
First Agenda, we did very occasionally receive
communications from members who were confused by the
absence of certain motions. However, in the context of the
ballot as a whole these incidents were few, and in general
most users seem to have navigated the ballot without
issue.

Additionally, as described above, the motion which became
E17 was added after the ballot had already begun, since it
was only by then that the proposers had made
amendments which SOC found would bring the motion
back into order. This necessarily caused some
disadvantage to that motion. Together with Conferences
Committee we attempted to ameliorate by writing directly
to those 44 users who had already voted by this time and
asking where they would rank this motion. Between us we
felt that this was the fairest, least disruptive way of
remedying any unfair disadvantage to this motion.
The Prioritisation ballot ended on 28th January and we ran
the Single Transferable Vote (STV) results by hand using
Excel and a calculator to obtain a Borda count. This took
considerable time, representing hours of work on the part
of the relevant SOC member.

Additionally, this was the first Prioritisation Ballot we have
run since the passage of a motion at Autumn Conference
2021 entitled ‘Prioritisation ballot for conference motions’.
This required the use of the Modified Borda Count method,
with a multiplier added to represent how many times the
same motion had been proposed to preceding Conferences
but not debated due to lack of time. This meant that SOC
had to make two determinations:

i) How similar does a motion need to be from one
Conference to the next in order for it to qualify? And
ii) Which motions proposed to Spring Conference 2022
were therefore eligible?
Having deliberated, we decided that, as with amendments,
textual changes to motions which do not substantially
change the scope or meaning of the motion would be
eligible, and this would require us to decide on a case-by-
case basis. We also decided that motions which were
debated and referred back were not eligible for the
multiplier, as the motion that created this new way of
calculating results explicitly stated that it applies to motions
that are not debated due to time constraints.

Accordingly, we decided to apply the multipliers as follows:

1. Reforming the process for holding the party’s AGM (1.5x
multiplier)
2. Antisemitism, Palestine, and free speech - endorsing
Jerusalem Declaration instead of IHRA (1.5x multiplier)
3. Consultation and Right of Reply for Liberation Groups
11
(2.5x multiplier)
4. Stonewall and disaffiliation from diversity champions
scheme (1.5x multiplier)
5. Public Service Delivery (1.5x multiplier)
6. Update to Wildlife Management and Control policy (1.5x
multiplier)

### 4. Timetabling, chairing and other procedural matters affecting conference including elections to be held at conference, with the recommendations of SOC

In order to facilitate faster progress on the Agenda, at each
conference SOC recommend motions for fast-tracking if
we think they are uncontroversial and if they have no
amendments.

Any motions to be fast-tracked are taken to have been
proposed and are voted on one by one immediately after
the SOC Report has been passed and without any debate. If
you have questions about motions proposed for fast-
tracking, you should ask them in a workshop.

If any ten members object to fast-tracking then the motion
is not fast-tracked. The ten objecting members have to be
on the “floor” of conference (as regards online-only
conferences, this means participating in Plenary). In an in-
person conference, this would not include members who
are voting remotely. If agreed for fast-tracking, then after
Conference passes the SOC Report, the vote on the fast-
tracked motion will include members who are voting
remotely.

Policy Development Committee have recommended the
following motions to SOC for fast-tracking by Conference:

E03 Enabling motion for rewrite of Transport section of
PfSS
E04 Enabling Motion for the revision of Economy Chapter of
‘Policies for a Sustainable Society’ (PSS)
E07 Fossil Fuel Non Proliferation Treaty
E09 Regulating Political Party Donations from Limited
Companies
E14 Enabling Motion on Tourism and Heritage Policy

Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC) as
revised Spring 2021 allowed Out of Order motions to be
revised and for us to recommend to Conference that they
are ruled back in order as part of the Final Agenda, as
happened on this occasion with motion E17.

We held weekly meetings with conference staff in the run-
up to conference. We also liaised with the Equalities and
Diversity co-ordinators at key stages. These were to
ensure that conference is run in an equitable and
accessible manner, reducing workload for all concerned as
far as possible.

The revised Standing Orders Section G5 allows all members
to register for remote voting online. This does not grant any
rights of participation other than watching the proceedings
and voting remotely online, though as of this Conference
SOC has proposed a motion to include remote attendance
in quoracy at Conference. It is currently open to chairs to
allow registered members to participate and due to Covid-
19 and other issues such participation may be requested by
members who have been unable to attend Conference in
person.

Following the ‘hybrid’ model of Conference, involving both
online and face to face participation, used at Autumn
Conference 2021, we became aware of a great deal of
positive feedback from Conference attendees. This
appeared to indicate that, where it is viable to do so, the
Green Party ought to use this model going forward as a
means to facilitate greater participation in Conference
business.

We will accept virtual speaker slips in advance from those
who hope to participate in conference plenary debate but
these will be at the chair’s discretion. We will take
procedural motions in advance for Reference Back and
Taking in Parts and Minor Textual Amendments. We can
only accept other procedural motions and speeches on
them from the Conference floor at physical conference.
The timetable has been set to allow for all A and C motions
to be taken. (There are no B motions this conference.) In
addition we expect to take at least one D motion and one E
motion, but this will be dependent on factors such as:

(i) fast-tracking of D and E motions
(ii) the additional time required by online voting processes
(iii) any additional time required by online participation
processes.

We will hold hustings and elections for the following
voluntary posts at Spring Conference:

1 member of Campaigns Committee
We notified Party members of these vacancies in advance.
We will open online voting from the end of hustings until
1pm on Sunday 6th of March and in-person voting from
10am to 1pm in the Conference venue. We hope to
announce the results at the end of the Sunday plenary. For
more information on voting please contact
ero@greenparty.org.uk.
The positions of Returning Officer and Deputy Returning
Officer (RO and DRO) are vital for the national party and
became vacant again following Autumn Conference 2021.
Knowing this, we advertised the vacancy in November
without a closing date, to allow for the greatest possible
number of applicants. We had five expressions of interest
which resulted in the appointment of Martin Hemingway as
RO and Alex Booth and Hamza Egal as DROs on the 23rd December 2021. As of 6th February 2022 Alex Booth
stepped back, leaving Hamza Egal as sole DRO.

### 5. The report of the Returning Officer (Martin Hemingway)

The results of committee elections at Autumn Conference
2021 can be accessed at:
https://members.greenparty.org.uk/conference/autumn-
2021/committee-results

### 6. A report by SOC of any changes that they have adopted to their Standing Orders;

No changes to our Standing Orders before publication of
the Final Agenda.


### 7. Progress on Organisational Statements;

Progress on our Organisational Statements in RoOS at
https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/roos/ and in Appendix 3
falls into three categories:

#### Category 1 (Completed)

• To update the Constitution in accordance with D01
Autumn Conference 2021 as passed with
amendments 1, 2 and 3 and publish to members.
• To update SOCC in accordance with D04 Autumn
Conference 2021 and publish to members
• To update and maintain the Record of
Organisational Statements (RoOS)
• To update SOPD in accordance with A10 Autumn
Conference 2021 as amended by amendments 4
to 9, 11 and ensure it is published to members.
• To improve the webform for submission of
motions, whether using an outside provider or
designed in-house (SOC Report Recommendation,
A1 Autumn 2020) with the support of GPEx.
Category 2 (Neither carried out nor
completed)
• To update SOC Standing Orders and/or
Handbook to reflect various motions passed at
Conferences viz: To ensure that the annual
ballots for the Green Party Executive (GPEx)
and the Policy Development Committee (PDC)

#### Category 2 (Neither carried out nor completed)

• To update SOC Standing Orders and/or
Handbook to reflect various motions passed at
Conferences viz: To ensure that the annual
ballots for the Green Party Executive (GPEx)
and the Policy Development Committee (PDC) are well publicised and fully engaged with by
the membership, To ensure that its appointee
to the role of ERO takes their role in
overseeing the conduct of the elections
seriously and takes an active role in
responding to complaints and concerns raised
about conduct during elections.
• To reconsider the proxy system for online
conferences and the 5-vote limit per
members and to bring forward proposals to
Conference to change this (SOC Report
Recommendation, A1 Autumn 2020).
• To carry out a full review of regulations for
national elections [ERO Report, part of SOC
Report Autumn 2020].
• To number motions in the Pre-Agenda
process if all of the possible motions continue
to be listed in one stream on the member
website (SOC Report Recommendation, A1
Autumn 2020).


#### Category 3 (Not applicable due to the circumstances not arising)

• To ensure with Policy Development Committee
that the Policy Process presentation at
https://members.greenparty.org.uk/node/59 is
updated if the member website changes (SOC
Report Recommendation, A1 Autumn 2020).
• To insert three clauses passed in D01 Autumn
2018 ‘Facilitating Incorporation of the GPEW’ into
the constitution “when the transfer happens”.

### 8. Any other matters or recommendations that do not affect the running of conference.

A huge thank-you to the staff who have assisted and
supported us during the year especially Louisa Greenbaum
and Cameron Bairstow.
Thankyou also to our predecessors on SOC who have been
generous with their time and energy in ensuring as smooth
a handover as possible to the current incarnation of the
Committee.

### 9. Rulings requested and made since the previous conference.

SOC continues to receive weekly requests for rulings and
advice between conferences. The workload has increased
in recent years due to complaints processes. We hope that
the use of regular, fortnightly meetings and the work-
sharing website Trello has sped up some parts of this
process, but progress remains variable. It can take just a
day but sometimes months to research, draft, agree a ruling, despatch it and post it to the SOC space. It is not
always clear at the start of the process whether a ruling or
interpretation of words in a Party document is the right
response. We may have problems in finding relevant
documents or Party documents may be silent on an issue.

The rulings or replies to requests for rulings as listed below
are:

#### Ruling Re Co-Option by Policy Development Committee

On 01.11.2021 Vix Lowthion asked:

‘I'm just seeking clarification regarding our co-options onto
PDC. We have 5 co-option slots on the committee
according to the constitution. But we have an additional 3
vacancies due to uncontested elections in the summer. The
full committee is 11 - we only have 3 elected (2 committee
plus me) and one currently co-opted.

Q1 Am I correct in that it is SOC's view that we can co-opt
the 8 vacancies rather than call an election?

Q2 Would these 8 co-options have voting rights? This can
be important when it comes to accreditation really.

Q3 And finally, does SOC have a view as to how long these
co-options are for, and

Q4 What mechanisms if any are available to remove a cooptee due to absence?’

SOC rules that

Clause 13(i) of the Constitution says:

"The Policy Development Committee [PDC] shall include
five members elected by ballot of the entire membership,
usually at the same time as the ballot for the membership
of the Executive is held. Up to an additional five non-voting
members may be co-opted by the elected Committee. This
co-option shall take place after an annual skills audit
carried out immediately following the election of the elected
members..."

Additionally, section 1.5 of the Standing Orders for PDC
says:

‘Immediately after the election of new members a skills
audit shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements of the constitution and a maximum of five
new members shall be co-opted for a 2 year term. This will
take place within one month of the election of new
members.’

Assuming the current composition of the PDC to include the
Policy Development Coordinator (elected in the annual
ballot), two elected members and a single co-opted
member, this means that:

1. PDC may co-opt four of the remaining vacancies;
the remaining three vacancies must be filled by a
ballot of the members. Since the Constitution says
that these elections ‘usually’, though not always,
take place at the same time as the annual ballot,
PDC is therefore urged to hold such a ballot as
soon as is practicable.

2. Only elected members of PDC may have voting
rights; co-opted members do not.

3. Co-opted members will serve a term of two years,
beginning from the election of committee
members immediately preceding their co-option.

4. Neither the Constitution nor the Standing Orders
for PDC currently contain any mechanism for
removing co-opted members, and so SOC cannot
give a conclusive answer to this question.

#### Response to CD re Leadership Terms Following Autumn Conference 2021

On 26.10.2021 Carla Denyer wrote:

‘…. I noticed that one of the amendments to the SOC report
changed our leadership term from 2 years to 3 years. Can
you please confirm to Adrian (in Cc) and me that this
amendment and motion, since passed, are now binding?’

On 22.11.2021 SOC responded:

Clause 8 (xi) of the Constitution says:

'If there are Co-leaders and one of the Co-Leaders resigns,
there will be a byelection for both Co-Leaders.... They shall
serve a term lasting as if they were starting following the
result of the previous Annual Ballot, or if held after May,
lasting as if it were starting following the result of the next
Annual Ballot.'

It bears emphasising that no motion was passed at
Conference which changed the Constitution so as to amend
the terms of those serving in the Leadership. The question
to be considered was what, for the purposes of this Clause,
constituted the 'next' Annual Ballot at the time of the most
recent Leadership by-election, given that the Annual Ballot
of 2021 and the Leadership by-election took place at
overlapping times.

In its original report to Autumn Conference in 2021, SOC
advanced a majority ruling to the effect that the 'next'
Annual Ballot, for these purposes, meant the Annual Ballot
of Autumn 2021, meaning that the term of those elected in
the Leadership by-election would run until Autumn 2023.

Subsequently, an amendment from the floor was passed
which interpreted the 'next' Annual Ballot, for these
purposes, to mean the Annual Ballot of Autumn 2022,
meaning that the term of those elected in the Leadership
by-election would run until Autumn 2024.

SOC sees no reason to go behind the decision of
Conference on this point. Moreover, SOC in its current
incarnation would, given the opportunity to consider the
question afresh, reach the same conclusion by majority.

Those elected at the Leadership by-election will therefore
serve terms running until Autumn 2024.

#### Ruling re ADRC Co-Option

On 11.11.2021 Marisa Johnson of ADRC wrote:

'... could you please let me know whether it would be in
order for the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee to
appoint two more members by cooption, to complete the
committee, which can now have seven members?'

SOC rules that

Clause 18(ii) of the Constitution says:

‘The Committee shall consist of seven members elected for
a two-year term of office, for a maximum consecutive term
of six years, at each Annual Party Conference, with
vacancies to be filled by election, or by co-options to be
ratified, at an intervention Conference.’

ADRC therefore has the power to appoint two more
members by co-option, with those co-options to be
ratified at the next Conference, which at time of writing will
be Spring Conference 2022.

#### Ruling re Term Limits

On 9.11.2021 Nate Higgins asked:

'Please may I request a ruling on the meaning, and how it
relates to local parties, of rule 5.XX of the constitution (as
passed at Spring 2021), which states:

"No member may be elected to the same post or sit on the
same body for more than 5 terms consecutively, nor be a
member of the Green Party Regional Council for more than
3 terms consecutively"

1.Does the rule apply to elected local party officer roles
required by the national constitution, i.e, Treasurer or
Nominating Officer?

2.Does the rule apply to elected local party officer roles not
required by the national constitution, i.e, a local party's
elected Election Agent?

3.Does the rule apply to bodies of local parties, i.e, an
Executive Committee of the local party?

4.Are partial terms in which a member is co-opted mid way
through a term count as one of the 5 terms a member may
serve?

5.Are partial terms in which a member is elected mid way
through a term count as one of the 5 terms a member may
serve?

6.Whose role in a local party is it to enforce this clause of
the constitution?'

[Numbering of questions added by SOC]

SOC rules that

Clause 5(i) of the Constitution says:

"5. i) Local Parties may be formed by groups of members of
The Green Party who shall determine their own constitution,
in accordance with bye-laws to be approved from time to
time by the Annual Conference.

The general practice of the Party shall be to encourage the
greatest possible autonomy of each Local Party in its
pursuit of the Object of the Party."

It is clear from context that the provision in Clause 5(xx) is
intended to refer to those national-level party bodies
outlined in the Constitution (including GPEx) and to
members of GPRC specifically, rather than to local parties
who shall be encouraged to have the greatest possible
autonomy, notwithstanding that their local party
constitutions shall themselves be determined according to
the bye-laws approved from time to time by Conference.

1. The term-limits and number of terms of
consecutive terms of service for local party officers
(including those roles required by the GPEW
Constitution) would be a matter for local parties to
decide using their own local party constitutions.

2. As at Q1 above, the term-limits and number of
terms of consecutive terms of service for local
party officers (including those roles not required by
the GPEW Constitution) would be a matter for local
parties to decide using their own local party
constitutions.

3. As at Qs 1 and 2 above, the rules governing term
limits on the bodies of local parties would be a
matter for local parties to decide using their own
local party constitutions.

4. So far as those national-level party bodies
outlined in the Constitution, including GPRC, are
concerned, the wording of Clause 5(xx) includes
both being ‘elected to’ a body and ‘sit[ting] on the
same body’ within its prescription of the 5 year/3
year limit. It is therefore clear that co-opted
members, who ‘sit on the same body’ though they
are not elected, would also be subject to these
provisions.
So far as local parties are concerned, as at Qs 1-3
above, this would be a matter for local parties to
decide using their own local party constitutions.

5. The wording of Clause 5(xx) does not refer to time
served on a party body or in a position, only to
elected terms. It is therefore clear that, so far as
those national-level party bodies outlined in the
Constitution, including GPRC, are concerned, a
partial term on which a member is co-opted part
way through, would count as one of the
determined number of terms that member may
serve.
So far as local parties are concerned, as at Qs 1-4
above, this would be a matter for local parties to
decide using their own local party constitutions.

6. The Constitution and bye-laws are silent on
whose role it is to enforce the terms of Clause
5(xx), and in any event as at Qs 1-5 above do not
apply to local party constitutions in the same way.
Therefore the question of whose role this is cannot
be determined by SOC using these provisions.
Ruling re Status of Emergency Motions
On 19.11.2021 Andi Mohr asked:
"Hope you can help - the co-leaders would like to request
your advice about the extent to which any emergency
motion that is passed by Conference can be considered to
have changed party policy more broadly.
Could you outline the limits that exist, if any, on what
emergency motions can change vs full motions?”

SOC rules that

The Constitution says:

"13.vii) Conference may make elaborations of previously
agreed policy as Topical Motions and Emergency Motions."

The Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC)
says:

"H13.8 Emergency Motions shall only be accepted
provided:

i) the issue has arisen, or has substantially changed, since
the deadline for Late Motions; an explicit commentary must
be provided by the lead proposer which explains why this
issue is an emergency, including evidence that the issue
that has arisen or has substantially changed since the
deadline;

ii) the motion is consistent with the PSS and neither
changes nor adds to the text of the PSS;

Iii) the motion has been proposed by a minimum of 50
individual members

iv) the motion is no longer than 250 words

v) the motion does not commit the Party to expenditure of
more than one hundred pounds without the approval of the
relevant budget holders

vi) the motion does not significantly alter the Party's agreed
political strategy."

This suggests the Constitution considers Emergency
Motions to have the same status as other motions; it is
simply a motion that has been submitted outside of the
regular timeframe.

But for the fact that they are accepted outside of a specified
timetable and cannot change policy more broadly (since,
per the SOCC they must be consistent with the text of PSS
and must not significantly alter the Party’s agreed political
strategy) the Constitution and SOCC otherwise make no
distinction between Emergency Motions and full motions.
Emergency Motions, in effect, are full motions, but full
motions that have been accepted outside of a specified
timetable so that the Party can respond to a specific
development.

Emergency Motions may elaborate policy for a specific
development, but they cannot be considered to have
changed party policy more broadly.

#### Ruling re Length of Terms on Policy Development Committee

On 22.11.2021 Vix Lowthion wrote:

Clause 13(i) of the Constitution says:

"The Policy Development Committee [PDC] shall include
five members elected by ballot of the entire membership,
usually at the same time as the ballot for the membership
of the Executive is held. Up to an additional five non-voting
members may be co-opted by the elected Committee. This
co-option shall take place after an annual skills audit
carried out immediately following the election of the elected
members..."

As GPEX members are elected for 2 year terms, in halves
with 50% up for relection each year, and PDC are to be
elected at the same time as GPEX and the term of office of
elected PDC members is not specified... could we please
have confirmation from SOC that PDC elected members are
in line with GPEX and PDCordinator and elected for two
year terms rather than every year? It is unclear in the
constitution and annual elections means that there is a lack
of stability and consistency and support for the policy
working groups to get policy through from start to finish
which can be 2 years.'

SOC rules that:

Since the Constitution specifies that PDC elections will
‘usually’ take place at the same time as the Annual Ballot,
but does not specify the length of terms served by
members of PDC, the Committee is driven to the conclusion
that members of PDC will serve a term of one year, with
annual elections.

It is acknowledged that members of GPEx serve for terms
of two years, and only 50% of its membership stands for
election in any given cycle of the Annual Ballot. However
this comes from a specific Constitutional provision at
Clause 7(iii):

’Elections for the GPEx Chair and Co-ordinator posts shall
be by a postal ballot of all members of the party with voting
included within the Annual Ballot. Half of these posts shall
be elected in one year and half in the next, so that their two
year terms are staggered.’

If PDC wish to change this, they would need to do so via an
amendment to the Constitution to specify the length of
terms served by members of PDC.

#### Advice re Constituted Groups

On 13.12.2021 Lois Davis wrote:

'I have submitted a marker motion on 'Defence of the NHS'
but made an error when posting on the pre-agenda forum
in that I submitted it in my name (Lois Davis) when it was
intended to be on behalf of Green Left. We are now ready to
post the final version of the motion and seek co-proposers
and I would like to know whether it will be possible to
propose the motion as a group (the group being Green Left )
rather than as an individual and if so whether SOC will
require 4 co-proposers or 12.'

SOC advises that

Standing Orders for Conduct of Conference (SOCC) B2.2
only makes provision for: local or Regional parties;
constituted national Committees; Working Groups approved
by Conference; or else groups recognised under the bye laws by Policy Development Committee or Campaigns
Committee to be counted as ‘groups’ for these purposes.
Clause 5(xii) of the Constitution sets out that common
interest groups (like Green Left) ‘may be accorded some or
all of the rights of a local or regional party by mutual
agreement with [GPRC]’, which should then allow them to
propose motions as a group, but only in that case.

We would recommend talking with GPRC and Campaigns
Committee to verify your status, but if you are not sure we
would advise that you treat this as an individual proposal.

#### Advice re Spokespeople Support and Monitoring Group

On 14.12.2021 Shahrar Ali wrote:

'I would appreciate a ruling and/or advice on a specific
situation.

I have been asked to address the SSMG, but the Chair has
been deliberately excluding one of the members of the
Group. The Terms of Reference are attached and detail its
membership, approved by GPEx on 31 July 2021, which
includes "Leadership representative".

However, our serving Co-leaders are being left out of
meetings and the general business of this Group for weeks
on end. On 15 Oct, the explanation given by the Chair was,
"The slot for a leadership representative is vacant while
Adrian and Carla find their feet." On 13 Dec, a similar
explanation was given that they were, "still being inducted
into their many and varied roles according to priority". It is
not that they have been invited or included and are
unavailable on a case by case basis, but rather they are
deemed to be not ready to join or to be inducted, despite
coming into post on 1 Oct. I have the following questions:

1. Is it compliant with these Terms of Reference that our
Co-Leaders should be exempted from business for these
sorts of reasons?

2. In any business which got escalated to GPEx by SSMG,
would our Co-Leaders be permitted to input into
deliberations at that stage even though they had forgone
the opportunity at SSMG?

3. How is a "Leadership representative" to be interpreted?
In the case of Co-Leaders is it either but not both? If they
were unavailable, could this include a representative of
theirs?

[Numbering added by SOC. A copy of the Terms of
Reference dated 17th June 2021 has been provided for
reference]

SOC rules that

Notwithstanding that these are the Terms of Reference
(ToR) of a committee created by Green Party Executive
(GPEx), it is appropriate in this case for SOC to provide its
‘best reading’ of the Terms of Reference for the purposes of
providing advice in relation to the above questions.
On reviewing the membership as set out in the ToR (which
included ‘a leadership representative’) and noting that it is
a task of the group to ‘meet four times a year’, SOC can
answer the proposed questions in the following way:

1. There is no explicit direction in the ToR mandating
attendance at meetings. However it is clear that
the Co-Leaders should, at minimum, be invited to
attend.

2. There is no explicit direction in the ToR mandating
attendance at meetings, or giving consequences
for non-attendance. Therefore, as members of
GPEx, Co-Leaders would be permitted to input
into deliberations at this stage.

3. Following discussion members of SOC were in
agreement that ‘Leadership representative’ could
reasonably be interpreted to mean, at least, any
single member of the Leadership team, ie. the Co-
Leaders and Deputy Leader. SOC was unable to
reach a view on whether this could encompass a
delegated person or other representative.

In relation to question 3 above SOC advises that it would be
best for GPEx to clarify what is meant by the term
‘Leadership representative’.


#### Advice re Election Rules for Local Parties and Affiliated Groups

On 07.01.2022 Ash Routh wrote:

‘Where EROs are running local party / affiliated party group
elections, they normally set out the rules for the election,
and resolve disputes related to the candidates.

Do EROs also have the power to create rules for voters to
follow?

For example, if an ERO instructs candidates that they
cannot run on slates, and that where they list candidates
for the election, they must do so in a specific order - can
the ERO also extend these rules to voting members? For
example, if a party member listed in public who their
preferred candidates were in a committee election, could
the ERO take any action again them?’

On 11.01.2022 Melanie Horrocks wrote:

‘It is, in my view, totally unacceptable for an internal ERO to
attempt to limit the article 10 [European Convention on
Human Rights] rights of members… no advice was taken
by their own admission, and setting their own election rules
cannot include limiting members’ own decisions on how to
express support for their candidates, in the way they  chose… I would like a ruling that the internal elections
rules set at the discretion of an ERO… cannot overrule the
ECHR/HRA…’’

Given the similarity and proximity of these two requests
SOC has decided to address them both with a single ruling.

SOC rules that

It must be said immediately that, while the GPEW and its
internal structures are ultimately subject to the law, SOC is
not equipped to adjudicate whether or not the behaviour of
Returning Officers amounts to a violation of the European
Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act.

Sections 17(iii)-(iv) of the Constitution state that:

‘The SOC shall appoint a Returning Officer (RO) and Deputy
Returning Officer (DRO) each year. The RO shall conduct
elections for office in the Party at national level which take
place by postal or Conference ballot. The DRO shall assist
the RO and deputise for the RO at the RO's request.

iv) The RO shall prepare election regulations for the conduct
of such elections. Such regulations shall be subject to the
approval of SOC, and shall be published to candidates. SOC
shall be the final authority for the interpretation of the
regulations, and within that interpretation the decision of
the RO shall be final.

The Constitution therefore limits the power of the RO/DRO
appointed by SOC specifically to national level elections.

Section 5(xii) of the Constitution states that:

‘Members with interests in common may form a group
subject to bye-laws approved from time to time by
Conference…. Such groups may be accorded some or all
of the rights of a Local Party by mutual agreement with the
Regional Council, subject to reference to the Alternative
Dispute Resolution Committee in the event of any
unresolved dispute.’

In line with the existing provision in section 5(i) of the
Constitution which states that the ‘general practice’ of the
Party will be to ‘encourage the greatest possible autonomy’
of each local party, and treating affiliated groups accorded
‘some or all of the rights of a Local Party’ as analogous, it
would appear that the arrangements made by the local
party or affiliated group in their own constitution/internal
processes take priority in deciding how such elections are
run, and it would be for the local party’s/affiliated group’s
Returning Officer to interpret those rules.

Disputes over election rules can, as a matter of general
practice, be taken up with Green Party Regional Council
(as part of their responsibility for ‘keeping under review
the general well-being of the party’ per section 6(i) of the
Constitution, and subject to reference to ADRC) and SOC,
but only where the matter cannot be satisfactorily
resolved at the level of a local party or affiliated group.

Should this become necessary, GPRC and SOC would be
assisted by the minutes of any meeting in which the rules
for the election in question were approved in accordance with the constitution of the local or regional party or the
affiliated group.

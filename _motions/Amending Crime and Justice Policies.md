## Synopsis
The Crime and Justice chapter has not undergone a major review since 1990. It needs updating to reflect and build on recent developments in progressive perspectives onto criminal justice and related policies. The motion proposes a new working group and a revision of the chapter.

## Motion
Conference instructs the Policy Development Committee to initiate a policy development process to rewrite and update the Crime and Justice chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society. The Policy Development Committee will convene a Crime and Justice Policy Working Group to undertake this.

This Working Group will refer to the core values and philosophical basis of the Green Party and seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in this area and other related fields. The Working Group will consider recent developments in progressive perspectives onto criminal justice and related policies, especially but not exclusively in the wake of the Movement for Black Lives and the renewed interest in critical perspectives onto criminal justice that has arisen from it.

Liaison and reference will be made to other policy working groups where appropriate. Views of other relevant organisations and professionals will also be sought and referenced in the background paper.

## Synopsis
Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise even though almost every nation says they should fall. Yet the failures of states and leaders escape effective criticisms at the COPs. This motion seeks to improve accountability at the COPs.

## Motion
Insert into RoPs:
Conference calls on the UK government, as the outgoing president of the COP, to ensure through the preparations for COP27 that:
*	The negotiations take place in a transparent, inclusive and accountable way, with parties and observers granted equal access to the negotiations.
*	Real-time access with simultaneous translation is provided for those unable to attend in person.
*	The design of the Global Stocktake includes robust science-based reviews of every country’s progress towards delivering their NDCs and analysis of the barriers to the delivery of those NDCs and the Paris targets. The representatives of groups affected by climate change, as well as those providing conditional support, will be invited to participate in this process.
*	The COP makes progress on agreeing a process whereby parties can be held accountable for:
*	their shortfalls in delivering their NDCs and in providing agreed climate finance
*	the losses and damages caused by their emissions.
*	COP considers a debt for climate agreement with low- and middle-income countries.

PSS
Insert into PSS (and re-number current CJ362 as CJ363):
CJ362 To establish a legal process to prosecute the people most responsible for the UK having failed to protect people and habitats from climate breakdown. This will include examination of Article 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the UK’s International Criminal Court Act 2001.

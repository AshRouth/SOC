## M﻿otion

**Add NR 424 after NR 423**

NR 424 Where resource taxes prove insufficient, import licences can be used instead. For some resources a system of import licences would be introduced. The import into the UK of these scarce resources in raw form, processed, or embedded in goods would require a licence. The National Resources Department would only issue a limited number of licences each year.

Through resource taxes, and limited issuing of import and domestic licences (see NR 420), the National resource department would aim to first stabilise Britain's consumption of scarce resources, and then steadily reduce that consumption over time.

**Current 423 (unchanged)**

A system of Resource Taxation will be introduced (see [ EC780](https://web.archive.org/web/20131113015343/http:/policy.greenparty.org.uk/index.php/ec#EC780)s) to impose a levy at the earliest possible point in the harvesting or extraction processes for all natural resources. The Natural Resource Tax will be applied at the forest, quarry, mine or port of entry, with the Natural Resources Department advising the Treasury on the levels at which it should be set. Resource Taxes will be levied at a zero or reduced rate on recycled materials and at a zero rate on reused products. The effect of Resource Taxation will be to encourage not only sustainable production but also waste reduction, recycling and avoidance through reuse and repair. As a transitional step towards the full introduction of Resource Taxation, a zero VAT rating will be introduced for the use of recycled materials and reused packaging.

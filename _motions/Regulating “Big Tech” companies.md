## Synopsis
The “Big Tech” companies have accumulated significant wealth and power, through operating in ways that existing regulation is not capable of addressing. The takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk has highlighted the importance of introducing such legislation. The Green Party will therefore introduce modern fit-for-purpose regulation for the tech sector.

## Motion
SOC note: This motion did not receive sufficient coproposals.

The Green Party will introduce regulation as follows.

Digital Markets:

To prohibit the use of personal data mined from one service to benefit a separate service they offer, restricting how business users of a gatekeeper’s platform sell their same service on another company’s platform, self-preferencing, and restrictions on targeted advertising without consent.

Online platforms to ensure that traders can only offer goods and services via their platforms after strict Know Your Customer procedures, and to ensure traceability of traders.

Requiring transparency on advertising prices, and interoperability with third-party software.

Empowering the levying of fines in cases of noncompliance, and in cases of systemic non-compliance, to restrict companies from making certain acquisitions of other companies.

Digital Services:

Online platforms to establish internal complaint-handling systems, engage with out-of-court dispute settlement bodies to resolve disputes with their users, publish detailed reports on their activities relating to the removal and the disabling of illegal content or content contrary to their terms and conditions.

Online platforms must provide, in real time, clear and unambiguous information to users that (i) they are seeing an advertisement, (ii) on whose behalf the ad is displayed, and (iii) provide meaningful information about the main parameters used to determine why a specific user is targeted by this ad.

Very large online platforms will have to also:

Analyse any systemic risk stemming from the use of their platforms and put in place effective content moderation mechanisms to address the identified risks (eg illegal content, privacy violations, impacts on free speech etc).

Provide transparency on the main parameters of the decision-making algorithms used to offer content. They must provide an option that is not based on profiling.

Establish and maintain a public repository with detailed information on the online advertisements they served on their platforms in the past year.

An obligation to designate a dedicated compliance officer and undergo an annual independent audit.

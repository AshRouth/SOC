## Synopsis
The “Big Tech” companies have accumulated significant wealth and power, through operating in ways that existing regulation is not capable of addressing. The Green Party will introduce modern fit-for-purpose regulation for the tech sector.

## Motion
The Green Party will introduce regulation as follows.

Digital Markets:

* Covering companies involved in: online marketplaces and app stores, search engines, social networks, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, cloud services, interpersonal communications services, web browsers, virtual assistants, connected TV, and affiliated advertising networks:
* Of companies that have: a significant impact on the UK market, the service it provides is an important gateway between businesses and end users, and it must have or be likely to soon have an entrenched and durable position.
* To prohibit: using personal data mined from one service to benefit a separate service they offer, restricting how business users of a gatekeeper’s platform sell their same service on another company’s platform, self-preferencing, and restrictions on targeted advertising without consent.
* Requiring transparency on advertising prices, and interoperability with third-party software.
* Empowering the levying of fines in cases of noncompliance, and in cases of systemic non-compliance, to restrict companies from making certain acquisitions of other companies.

Digital Services:

* Every hosting provider or online platform to put in place user-friendly notice and takedown mechanisms that allow the notification of illegal content.
* Online platforms to establish internal complaint-handling systems, engage with out-of-court dispute settlement bodies to resolve disputes with their users, publish detailed reports on their activities relating to the removal and the disabling of illegal content or content contrary to their terms and conditions.
* Online intermediaries to include in their terms and conditions information on any restrictions on the use of data provided by the users, with reference to the content moderation mechanisms applied, algorithmic decision-making and human review
* Online platforms to ensure that traders can only offer goods and services via their platforms after strict Know Your Customer procedures, and to ensure traceability of traders.
* Online platforms must provide, in real time, clear and unambiguous information to users that (i) they are seeing an advertisement, (ii) on whose behalf the ad is displayed, and (iii) provide meaningful information about the main parameters used to determine why a specific user is targeted by this ad.
    Empowering the levying of fines in cases of non-compliance.

Very large online platforms will have to also:

* Analyse any systemic risk stemming from the use of their platforms and put in place effective content moderation mechanisms to address the identified risks (eg illegal content, privacy violations, etc).
* Provide transparency on the main parameters of the decision-making algorithms used to offer content on their platforms (the rankings mechanism) and the options for the user to modify those parameters. They must provide an option that is not based on profiling.
* Establish and maintain a public repository, available via application programming interfaces, with detailed information on the online advertisements they served on their platforms in the past year.
* An obligation to designate a dedicated compliance officer and undergo an annual independent audit.

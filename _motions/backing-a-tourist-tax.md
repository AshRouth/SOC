## Synopsis

Tourist taxes are commonplace in many European cities. They provide local authorities with a stream of income to invest in infrastructure that benefits local residents and tourists, offsetting the impact that tourism can sometimes introduce. Greens have already backed tourist taxes at regional elections like the Mayor of London elections

## Motion

Insert new HT044: Local authorities will be given the power to introduce a tourist levy, to help fund infrastructure and new housing

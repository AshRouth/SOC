## Motion
Motion Text

CC180 A future Green Government will need to take temporary emergency powers to support a rapid transition in the economy and society.

CC 181 A Green government will take temporary emergency powers to ensure that emissions reductions are achieved while also ensuring energy, food and financial security for the population. These powers will take the form of intervention in company and corporate boardrooms by taking a 'golden share', allowing the government to take over the direction of the company for the duration. For example, the investment decisions of oil companies will be redirected towards the support of new renewable energy sources and infrastructure both at home and abroad.

CC 182 A Green government will take temporary powers to control the inflow and outflow of capital, in order to ensure there is no capital flight from the economy that might undermine future regulations designed to ensure the constructive use of capital markets in the service of the survival of the human race in future.

CC 183 The government will take temporary powers to allocate quantities of goods and services to private individuals or households. These would include the availability of road fuels (petrol and diesel), electric cars, leisure flights, and meat and dairy foods, especially lamb and beef. These allocations will be varied to meet individual circumstances.

CC 184 The government will take temporary powers to re-establish a free press, ensuring that wealthy proprietors and share-holders, at home or abroad, cannot use the press for purposes of disinformation. It will do this by ensuring that newspapers and broadcasters will be accountable to editorial boards drawn from a wide range of civil society organisations.

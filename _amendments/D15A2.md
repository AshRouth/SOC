In next proposed paragraph, delete clause, “or a gender non-conforming/non-binary person,”
So that new proposed sentence reads,
Two members, of whom at least one must be a woman, may together stand for the office of Leader in order to hold the post as a job share in which case they shall be known as ‘Co-Leaders’.

Two members, of whom at least one must be a woman or a gender non-conforming/non-binary person, may together stand for the office of Leader in order to hold the post as a job share in which case they shall be known as ‘Co-Leaders’’. In this case a single Deputy, the individual who polls the highest vote, regardless of gender, will be elected. Members standing to be Co-Leaders may not simultaneously be candidates as individuals for either Leader or Deputy Leader.”

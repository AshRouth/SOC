Delete the following from motion:

At the end, insert “The transition to an equitable and sustainable economy must be facilitated at the speed and scale needed.” so that it reads:
“PB412 New economic ideas, institutions and organisations are needed to reduce our dependence on such symbols. Economic policy should be directed not to maximising the forms of wealth that can be measured in monetary terms, but to ensuring that the needs of all are met. The transition to an equitable and sustainable economy must be facilitated at the speed and scale needed.”

And Replace with:
At the end, insert “Our economy must be changed to become equitable and sustainable. This requires rapid, wide ranging and disruptive interventions.” so that it reads:
“PB412 New economic ideas, institutions and organisations are needed to reduce our dependence on such symbols. Economic policy should be directed not to maximising the forms of wealth that can be measured in monetary terms, but to ensuring that the needs of all are met. Our economy must be changed to become equitable and sustainable. This requires rapid, wide ranging and disruptive interventions.”

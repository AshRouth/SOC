In the sentence in the motion which reads:

Where there are posts where there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are women or gender diverse, noting that gender is self-determined, or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are people of colour, nominations will reopen for these posts.

Insert after “people of colour,”

or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who self-identify as having a disability, then

So that it reads:
Where there are posts where there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are women or gender diverse, noting that gender is self-determined, or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are people of colour, or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who self-identify as having a disability, then nominations will reopen for these posts.

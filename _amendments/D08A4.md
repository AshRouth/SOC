amendment_number: 4
---

Insert new third paragraph:

”Stonewall has every right to undertake political campaigns
as a charity, but our affiliation also jeopardises our
independence as a political party, or perception thereof, to
interrogate statistics and value assumptions in developing
policies of our own ! without bias.”

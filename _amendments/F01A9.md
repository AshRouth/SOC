Insert into current LP505, “and land”, and “and local
levels”, so that it reads, “LP505 Local planning authorities
have a duty to implement their Local Plans within the
constraints of the existing built environment and land they
oversee, and within carbon and land budgets set at
national, regional and local levels. This provision should
meet the need identified in housing strategies (see HO401!
409).

Delete from current LP506, “for example by integrating
natural habitats into solar farms or on rooftops”,

so that it reads, “LP506 As far as possible, the demand for
new urban land should be minimised through a
combination of demand!reduction policies (see for
example HO401) and through optimising densities.

Land value taxation would create incentives to bring
forward empty brownfield sites for development, and local
authorities would be given stronger powers to tackle
remaining land hoarding (see LP516).

Any development of present settlements should be confined
within the existing boundaries where possible, and where a
loss of countryside is deemed necessary it should go on the
least sensitive land that is most accessible by public
transport, cycling and walking to existing economic and
social facilities.

The maximum environmental value should also be obtained
on land used for development.”

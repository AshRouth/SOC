In Clause 7 change:

Delete:

and 12 people will be elected every year, using single transferable vote and add in: three from each region and Wales. One member for each region and Wales will be elected every year in a regional instant run off election as part of the annual ballot. Only members for each region or Wales will be

Delete:

and 12 people will be elected every year, using single transferable vote

Add after:
Any member will be eligible to stand unless that will mean all the councillors from the region / Wales are the same gender identity, in which case only members whose gender identity differs from the sitting councillors can stand.

So the first paragraph reads:

7) Council will be increased to 30 people, three from each region and Wales. One member for each region and Wales will be elected every year in a regional instant run off election as part of the annual ballot.

Only members for each region or Wales will be eligible to vote for their respective council member. Each council memberâ€™s term will be for 3 years. Any member will be eligible to stand unless that will mean all the councillors from the region / Wales are the same gender identity, in which case only members whose gender identity differs from the sitting councillors can stand.

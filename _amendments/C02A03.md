The motion now reads

“we demand that the government makes the case, as acts of solidarity with Ukraine, for people to reduce
their personal energy use.

• Heating buildings less.

Delete “Heating buildings less.

Substitute:

“Reducing excessive heating. Since those on lower incomes already drive, fly and heat their homes less than the UK average, this initiative would be targeted at those on higher incomes.”

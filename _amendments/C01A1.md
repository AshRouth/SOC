In Part 1
Delete Synopsis and Motion for Motion Part 1: Decoupling Electricity Costs From Gas and replace with:
“Synopsis
This motion proposes that the party campaigns to remove the absurd coupling of low-carbon electricity prices and gas prices.  Analysis in the Green Party finds decoupling would have reduced net electricity costs by £3.7bn in Q4 2022. Decoupling can be implemented almost immediately by Ofgem.
Motion
Conference Notes:
●        Policy EN095 states “Energy regulation will be aimed at helping to achieve environmental and social objectives, and a fair and accountable energy sector.”
●        The UK energy crisis causing extreme fuel poverty. Today’s very high gas prices have made this the critical issue of the day.
●        Electricity is sold in a market in which the costliest generator sets the price paid to all: if gas costs £400/unit, then all generators in the wholesale market get £400/unit.
●       The Autumn 2022 Financial Statement (November 2022) predicted that the Electricity Generator Levy would raise £1.035 bn in Q1 2023.
Decoupling low-carbon electricity prices from gas fuelled electricity prices could:
●        Reduce electricity bills for all (rich/poor, householder/business).
●        Be delivered immediately using proven instruments like Contracts for Difference, which also stimulate investment in renewables.
To address the issue, Government has introduced the Electricity Generator Levy which seeks to recoup excess profits from generators.  Analysis in the Green Party finds our alternative decoupling proposal could have reduced net electricity costs by £3.7bn in Q1 2023. Unlike the Government proposal, decoupling directly reduces the cost of electricity.
Conference therefore requests:
●        GPEx/Leadership to campaign for emergency legislation to decouple the price of low carbon electricity from gas through market reform.
●        GPEx/Leadership to continue campaigning for renewables and improved energy-efficiency to achieve gas-free electricity.
●        Climate Emergency Policy Working Group to continue working for ways to ensure the benefits of low carbon energy are equitable, including responsible market regulations.”

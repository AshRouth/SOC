Amendment to Standing Orders Committee report regarding order of D12 and D13 by Disciplinary Committee

Under Amendments to section D.

“There have been 20 proposed amendments to motions in section D, of which we ruled 4 out of order and have proposed that 2 be basketed together.

The ranking is as in the Prioritisation Ballot, except for D01, in relation to which we exercised our discretion under Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference, paragraph F2.6(c), to give special priority to any motion in section D which we consider to be urgent for the functioning of the party or any part of it.”

Insert after “except for D01” “D13 and D12,”

Insert a new paragraph “For D12, it is recommended that it be taken in parts so that only those revisions to Standing Orders for Party Discipline referring to increasing the size of the Disciplinary Committee are debated, all other revisions being proposed to be referred back.”

so that it reads

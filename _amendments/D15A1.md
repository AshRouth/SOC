In subsection 4, Art 8 of constitution, delete proposed clause “or a gender non-conforming/non-binary person, noting that gender is self-determined.”
So that new proposed sentence reads,
“The post of deputy leader will be held as a job share with two individuals, at least one of whom must be a woman.”
Replace:
“Two members of a different gender may together stand for the office of Leader in order to hold the post as a job share in which case they shall be known as ‘Co-Leaders’”
With:
Two members, of whom at least one must be a woman or a gender non-conforming/non-binary person, may together stand for the office of Leader in order to hold the post as a job share in which case they shall be known as ‘Co-Leaders’.
So that Subsection iv reads:
“The post of deputy leader will be held as a job share with two individuals, at least one of whom must be a woman or a gender non-conforming/non-binary person, noting that gender is self-determined.

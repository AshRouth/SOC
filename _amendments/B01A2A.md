- from LD303, "(for example where an owner cannot be established, which ceases to have an owner, or for which ownership is removed (see LD304))”

LD304 The Commons Trusts would be empowered to:
•	provide advice and guidance on land stewardship
•	facilitate mediation on land stewardship conflicts in communities
•	facilitate voluntary reparations for the restoration of land
•	issue warnings regarding failures of land stewardship
•	as a last resort, enforce stewardship requirements by preparing a prosecution case for referral to the legal system Where land is held by companies or other organisations, directors or board members will be held personally responsible for failures of land stewardship. Restorative justice is preferred, with the minimal intervention required to deliver that justice (see RR1002-1003,CJ200-206 & CJ362). The maximum penalty for breach of stewardship would be removal of the land, by compulsory purchase by the Commons Trust (as the first charge prior to all other liabilities, including the banks/ and other lenders), with the deduction of reparations and costs. Where land is held by limited companies, directors may be held personally responsible.

Re changes to FA301:

The DVP proposes to insert:

”The carbon tax will be applied both to agricultural inputs
(such as diesel and fertilisers) and GHG implications of long
term land use changes by extending planning system to
rural land (see EC777).

Alter to read: “\*The carbon tax will be applied to
agricultural inputs (such as diesel and fertilisers), and the
GHG implications of long term land use changes. The effect
of taxing continuing greenhouse gas emissions from land
use will be achieved through the farm support system.\*

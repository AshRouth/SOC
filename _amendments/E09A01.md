Add clause, “, whilst sex is immutable,” in first sentence, between “that” and “there”, so that amended motion now reads:
RR530 The Green Party recognises that, whilst sex is immutable, there are many gender identities that are within, and outside of, the traditional gender binary of man and woman. The Green Party recognises that, as statements of gender identity, trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid. We shall respect transgender and non-binary people’s identities as valid. The Green Party shall include, and push for further acceptance of, transgender and non-binary people within all areas of society.

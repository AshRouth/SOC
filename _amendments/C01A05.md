“CC015 The UK should base its future emissions budgets on the principles of science and equity with the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 C. These principles entail the UK reducing its own emissions, both territorial and consumption, to net zero as soon as possible. The urgency of these objectives requires the UK to make overcoming the technological, political and social obstacles a national priority.”

“CC015 The Green Party accepts the scientific consensus that great, and perhaps irreversible, harm will be done if the global temperature rises to more than 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial level.

The urgency of these objectives requires the UK to make overcoming the political, social and technological obstacles a national priority.”

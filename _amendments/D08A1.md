amendment_number: 1

1! Insert in second sentence, after “Equality and Human
Rights Commission” the following:

”BBC and UCL,” so that this sentence now reads:
“Lately, however, public organisations and bodies,
including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, BBC
and UCL, have found reasons to disaffiliate from their
Diversity Champions Scheme.”

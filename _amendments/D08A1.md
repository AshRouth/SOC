Delete clause in second sentence of proposed motion, “or gender diverse, noting that gender is self-determined,” so that new proposed sentence reads:
Where there are posts where there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are women or there is not at least one valid nomination from candidates who are people of colour, nominations will reopen for these posts.

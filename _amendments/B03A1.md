Inclusion of two new NATO reform points in addition to the five listed reform points. This would result in paragraph PSD319 containing a total of seven NATO reform points with the final two points No 6 and No 7 being stated as follows:
•	A guarantee that abiding by International Treaties, Conventions and UN Resolutions shall always take precedence over other considerations in determining NATO's actions.

•	A commitment to jointly discuss security concerns of third country neighbour states prior to extending NATO membership

Other Treaties
Antarctica
PSD330 The Green Party supports the continuation and extension of the Antarctic Treaty, and the continued prohibition on any form of military activities on that continent.
Seabed Treaty
PSD331 The Green Party Supports the 1971 Seabed Arms Control Treaty which seeks to prevent a nuclear arms race on the Ocean floor.
Missile Defence
PSD 332 Developments since the 2002 withdrawal of the US from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, have meant that ABM sites can be seen as components of a first strike nuclear strategy by preventing any retaliatory strike. As such they are dangerously destabilising systems, have increased international tension and are themselves targets. Therefore, we will end all ABM related activity in the UK.

motion_title: Revisions to Standing Orders for Party Discipline
amendment_number: 1
---

““The Committee shall consist of eleven members of the
Party who are not members of the Green Party Executive
(GPEx), the Green Party Regional Council (GPRC), Alternative
Dispute Resolution Committee (ADRC) or Standing Orders
Committee (SOC).”
If the motion “Change to the Constitution for Disciplinary
Committee” is passed, then delete and replace with:
“The Committee shall consist of members of the Party who
are not members of the Green Party Executive (GPEx), the
Green Party Regional Council (GPRC), Disputes Resolution
Committee (DRC) or Standing Orders Committee (SOC) who
have been elected or appointed by each GPEW region and
the nation of Wales.””
It has been pointed out that this is unclear; therefore
replace with:
“The Committee shall consist of members of the Party who
have been elected or appointed by each GPEW region and
the nation of Wales. They may not be members of the
Green Party Executive (GPEx), the Green Party Regional Council (GPRC), Alternative Disputes Resolution Committee
(ADRC) or Standing Orders Committee (SOC).”

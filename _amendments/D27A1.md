Replace 6)v as proposed:
“No Council member can continuously serve more than two terms or six years whichever is the greater.”
With the following:
“No person can be elected to more than two full terms consecutively. Terms will be considered non-consecutive if they are approximately one year apart. Members elected to a shortened term at the first Annual Ballot or elected to a shortened term to fill a vacancy are not considered to be elected to a full term.”

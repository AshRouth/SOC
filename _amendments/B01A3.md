Food and Agriculture

FA203 currently reads:
“FA203 Financial Support for Food and Farming – access to nutritious food is a right which should be upheld and so we will use public funds to support the production of wholesome food in environmentally and socially sustainable ways.
•	We will change the basis of agriculture support toward supporting a combination of sustained, fairly rewarded employment, , producing nutritious food, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, high standards of animal welfare, enhancing wildlife habitats, providing ecosystem services and promoting a transition to non-chemical methods of farming.
•	We will develop a mechanism to intervene, when necessary to ensure that prices and incomes are fair and sustainable throughout the food system.
•	As a condition of public support farmers and growers should declare the production methods and inputs that they use and this information will be made publicly available.
•	We will encourage new entrants to agriculture and horticulture and enable access to land and the provision of the necessary finance and training.”
In the first bullet point under FA203, delete the following: “We will change the basis of agriculture support toward supporting a combination of sustained, fairly rewarded employment, , producing nutritious food, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, high standards of animal welfare, enhancing wildlife habitats, providing ecosystem services and promoting a transition to non-chemical methods of farming.”
And replace with: “Agriculture support will be provided by the Land Management Investment and Support scheme (see LD505). This will encourage a combination of sustained and fairly rewarded employment, producing nutritious food, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, high standards of animal welfare, enhancing wildlife habitats, the providing of ecosystem services and the promoting a transition to non-chemical methods of farming.”
FA204 (first bullet) currently reads,
“Intermediary Bodies – in order to achieve the required transformation of the Food and Agriculture Systems we will need to establish an organisational infrastructure to support and sustain the changes. We will:
•	Establish a Food and Agriculture Commission to develop and implement the structural and financial changes including changes to agriculture support, regulation and taxation that we propose to introduce.”.
To reflect the changes introduced in the new Land Chapter, replace with
“Intermediary Bodies – in order to achieve the required transformation of the Food and Agriculture Systems we will need to establish an organisational infrastructure to support and sustain the changes. We will:
•	Establish a Food and Agriculture Commission to develop and implement structural and financial changes, including changes to land management investment and support, regulation and taxation. Changes will be delivered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Forestry Commission (see LD505)
FA301 currently reads:
“FA301 Food, Agriculture and Climate Change – climate change is the most profound challenge facing the planet. Agriculture and food production account for some 10% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Soil is the most important carbon store in the UK.
•	All farmers will be supported through advice and guidance to manage their farms to reduce GHG emissions to net zero by 2030. Carbon sequestration will be one of the outcomes to attract payment under the revised farming support scheme.
•	We will set rigorous targets for GHG reductions, to reduce emissions to zero by 2030 across the Food and Agriculture System to cover farms and the whole supply, manufacturing and distribution system including imports.
•	We will promote a move to a diet with significantly less meat consumption that will require fewer farm animals, reducing emissions from ruminant digestion and releasing areas of grassland for crops, forestry or wildlife.
•	We will introduce a carbon tax and this will apply both to agricultural inputs and to agricultural products based on the net greenhouse gases released during their production.
•	We support the development of appropriate renewable energy systems on farms; we will monitor the growing of crops specifically for fuel.
•	Lowland peat soils are vulnerable to erosion and carbon loss; we will support applied research to ensure that they are managed in a manner that reduces GHG emissions and returns them to being net sequesters of carbon.”
In the first bullet point under FA301, delete the second sentence:
“Carbon sequestration will be one of the outcomes to attract payment under the revised farming support scheme.”
And replace with:
“Land management investment and support will encourage food production, carbon sequestration and discourage greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities.”
In the third bullet point under FA301, delete:
“We will promote a move to a diet with significantly less meat consumption that will require fewer farm animals, thus reducing emissions from ruminant digestion and releasing areas of grassland for crops, forestry or wildlife.”
And replace with:
“We will promote a move to a diet with significantly less meat consumption that will require fewer farm animals. This will reduce emissions from ruminant digestion and release land for crops, forestry and wildlife.”
In the fourth bullet point under FA301, delete:
“We will introduce a carbon tax and this will apply both to agricultural inputs and to agricultural products based on the net greenhouse gases released during their production.”
And replace with:
“The carbon tax will be applied to agricultural inputs (such as diesel and fertilisers) (see EC777). Significant land use emissions will be in part limited through the planning systems and land designations. (See LD504).”
In the sixth and final bullet point under FA301, delete:
“Lowland peat soils are vulnerable to erosion and carbon loss; we will support applied research to ensure that they are managed in a manner that reduces GHG emissions and returns them to being net sequesters of carbon.”
And replace with:
“Lowland peat soils are vulnerable to erosion and carbon loss; we will restore them to being net sequesters of carbon (see LD402).”
FA602 first bullet currently reads:
FA602 Healthy and Sustainable Food Standards
•	We will support a progressive transition from a diet dominated by meat and animal products to one with a higher proportion of plant-based foods by public education and the operation of the carbon tax.
Change the first bullet so that it reads:
FA602 Healthy and Sustainable Food Standards
•	We will support a progressive transition from a diet dominated by meat and animal products to one with a higher proportion of plant-based foods led via public education, public procurement and the impact of carbon tax (EC777) and changes to public investment and support for intensive meat and dairy production (LD505).

Forestry

Delete “FR200
1.	Sustained cooperative relationship between public and private estates.
2.	Increase the area of cover in the UK to average cover across Europe.
3.	UK self-sufficiency in forest products.
4.	Optimise the quantity and quality of all forest products.
5.	Increase the involvement, employment and enjoyment of local communities.
6.	Maintain and protect ancient woodland and priority habitats.
7.	Protect and increase the Public Forest Estate (PFE).”.
And replace with
“FR200
Increase the area of cover in the UK to be between 30% and 40% in 10 years, meeting these forestry objectives within the context of the land use key outcomes (See LD200):
•	Sustained cooperative relationship between public and private estates
•	UK net self-sufficiency in forestry products to displace some fossil fuel based products (eg plastics).
•	Optimise the quantity and quality of all forest products.
•	Increase the involvement, employment and enjoyment of local communities.
•	Maintain and protect ancient woodland and priority habitats as well as increasing biodiversity, abundance and soil health.
•	Protect and increase the Public Forest Estate (PFE).
•	Increase the area of fruit and nut trees
•	Increase the biomass of living trees for carbon sequestration and remove pinewood from peatland to eliminate emissions
•	Allow for the use of forest residue and waste wood as well as limited plantation for energy.”.
FR401 Add references to the Land chapter, so that the paragraph reads, “FR401 The expansion of the UK estate/tree cover shall be driven through three component parts (in addition to other policy levers described in LD502).
•	Forest Services, to manage the land cover of the PFE, allocate grants, enforce regulations and implement and police pest control
•	Forest Research, to oversee and coordinate research through the PFE, academia and the commercial sector
•	Forest Enterprise, to manage the PFE sustainably, plant, grow and fell standing timber, sustain balanced supply chains and encourage access.”.
Delete “FR600 A Green Government will facilitate an increase in overall tree cover so that it reaches a level that is on a par with average coverage in countries across Europe, consisting of unmanaged forest and woodland; harvested forest and woodland; unharvested (but managed) forest and woodland; short rotation forest and woodland; short rotation coppice; and agroforestry.”.
And replace with “FR600 An increase in overall tree cover shall be facilitated so that it achieves the objective in FR200, consisting of unmanaged forest and woodland; harvested forest and woodland; unharvested (but managed) forest and woodland; woodland; open canopy woodland; and agroforestry.”.
Delete “FR700 A Green Government will facilitate extensive planting of short rotation forestry and coppice for energy production.”.
And replace with “FR700 Planting of short rotation forestry and coppice for energy production shall be facilitated, where land use priorities allow. (See LD401)”.
Insert new “FR701 Forest and sawmill residues can be used for energy production, but only if they are not better applied to preserving forest soil health and sequestering carbon, increasing biodiversity or producing other wood products.”.
FR800 currently reads, “Supporting Green Party Industrial Policies IP202 and IP241, and the climate emergency policy CC260, a Green Government will work to reduce UK imports of timbers that can be grown in the UK to zero, and also promote a 'Wood First' policy in all new buildings and in retrofitting existing ones.”.
Insert into current FR800, the words, “a Green Government will work to reduce”, before “UK imports”, “and wood products” after “timbers” and “net”, before “zero”, so that it reads:
“FR800 Supporting Green Party Industrial Policies IP202 and IP241, and climate change policy CC260, a Green Government will work to reduce UK imports of timbers and wood products that can be grown in the UK to net zero, and also promote a 'Wood First' policy in all new buildings and in retrofitting existing ones.”
In FR1400, replace “energy creation”, with “ energy production” and a reference at the Land chapter, so that it reads:
“FR1400 Funding shall be provided for innovative and targeted research, including different timber species' strengths and utility; CO2 sequestration potential, future planting needs and species suitability under climatic changes; mapping research on land areas most suited to energy production, food growing, urban growth and conservation; planting opportunities mapping; research into organic pest control; climate emergency adaptation and resilience opportunities, particularly flood mitigation (See LD503).”.

Housing

In HO401(a), replace the reference to LD400 (LVT), with a reference to EC780, where the substantive policy sits, so that it reads:
“a) gradually introduce a Land Value Tax (see EC780) to reduce profits from speculation on existing homes and development sites, and in the short term increase the amount of land held by Community Land Trusts (see HO513-514);”.

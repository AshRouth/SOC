In section 1 of A01, ‘Final Agenda etc.’

To the section marked ‘Amendments to section E’

Insert the following text:

‘It was noted following publication of the Final Agenda that there may potentially be a conflict, hitherto unnoticed, between a part of Motion E19 and [Motion X] passed at Spring Conference 2022, where Conference had supported a halt to HS2 works on the [Relevant Chalk Aquifer].

As of 25 September 2022 SOC determined that, having reviewed the motions, this meant that the words ‘in full’ should be removed from motion E19 as OoO, being in conflict with a motion passed at a Conference immediately preceding this one. The remainder of the motion remained in order.’

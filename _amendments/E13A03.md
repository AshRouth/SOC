‘Renumber to PB109’
To this end, the Green Party of England and Wales will contest elections open to the English and Welsh electorates. We do not believe that electoral politics is the only way to change society, or that we have all the answers. We, therefore, seek to facilitate and cooperate with movements and initiatives which share our values, principles and objectives to achieve change through a variety of non-violent means, tactics and strategies.”

Insert after strategies
‘Our Ecosocialist values means as a party we stand for system change not climate change and the ongoing destruction of nature for private profit.’

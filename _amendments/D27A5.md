Delete the existing clause headed Transitions and replace with the following:
“Following the passing of this motion we will transition to the new format of the Council as follows:
At the first Annual Ballot, only 12 Council seats shall be up for election.
At all future Annual Ballots, 12 seats shall ordinarily be up for election (the seats of the Councillors whose terms are expiring in that year) and the 12 Councillors elected shall serve for a three year term.
Any existing members of GPRC will transition to become full voting members of the Council, with their terms expiring in line with their existing mandate. If any such Regional Councillor is elected to the Council at an Annual Ballot, they shall immediately cease to be a member by way of this transition clause. If any Regional Councillor ceases to be a member of the Council, or is elected to the Council at an Annual Ballot, the region which elected them shall not replace them.
This clause shall be removed automatically once all of the following have taken place:
•	The first Annual Ballot has concluded,
•	The terms of any and all Regional Councillors have expired.

CC015 currently reads:

“CC015 The UK should base its future emissions budgets on the principles of science and equity and the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 C. These principles entail the UK reducing its own emissions to net zero by 2030 and seeking to reduce the emissions embedded in its imports to zero as soon as possible.
The urgency of these objectives requires the UK to make overcoming the technological, political and social obstacles a national priority.”

In the first sentence, replace “and” with “with”, and in the second sentence, after “reducing its own emissions” insert “, both territorial and consumption,” and delete “by 2030 and seeking to reduce the emissions embedded in its imports to zero”, so that it reads:
“CC015 The UK should base its future emissions budgets on the principles of science and equity with the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 C. These principles entail the UK reducing its own emissions, both territorial and consumption, to net zero as soon as possible. The urgency of these objectives requires the UK to make overcoming the technological, political and social obstacles a national priority.”

Insert:
“CC016 The Green Party of England and Wales will continue to develop a policy package that will reduce the UK's emissions to net zero as quickly as possible. Updates on targets and forecasts will be recorded in Record of Policy Statements, Green Party manifestos and reports to conference.”
Renumber CC016 and CC017 to CC017 and CC018 accordingly.

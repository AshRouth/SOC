"Key is how does the party take on board the fears of Trans members and simultaneously address the concerns of some feminist members? Members of both groups are feeling side-lined. Moreover, we openly display ageism and BAME members are still woefully under-served."

Replace with:
Key is how does the party tackle the discrimination and marginalisation experienced by members? Such as transphobia, homophobia, ageism, racism, antisemitism, misogyny, ableism & classism, which is openly displayed in the party.

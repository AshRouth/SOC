LD503 To build capacity and deliver a just transition we will need to facilitate a mindset change to a new way of using land. We will need education, training, and support services. It is also critical that there is support for people whose livelihoods will need to change (IN205, MC363). Measures will include:
•	Public information campaigns
•	Funding for land use research (see FR1400, FA301)
•	Funding and expansion of agricultural colleges and land based apprenticeships (see FA204)
•	Start-up funding for young entrepreneurs in agriculture/horticulture (see FA203) * Farm and land business advisory services (see FA202, FA204, FA301, FA304).
•	Support for retraining and relocating.

LD504 The planning system will provide accountability and local democratic control over land use through compliance with local and regional plans. It will provide a mechanism for levying carbon tax (EC777) against land use change emissions associated with construction. In particular there will need to be land use designations for permanent pasture, forestry, peatland and land under agricultural rotation. See also FA301, LP412, LP505, LP514 and LP517.

LD505 Land management investment and support will be delivered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Forestry Commission. See also the Economics (EC781), Food and Agriculture Chapter (FA304, FA203, FA202-204), Wildlife and Habitats Chapter (WH100-106), and Forestry Chapter (FR603).

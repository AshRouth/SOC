iii) Add the word “modified”  between ‘seven-seat’ and ‘single transferable vote’ to read:
Elections for the GPEx Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary member posts shall be by a ballot of all members of the party with voting included within the Annual Ballot. The Chair and Treasurer shall be elected in one year in individual ballots by instant run off, at the same time as the Leader(s) plus Deputy Leader(s), and the ordinary members in the next year by a seven-seat modified single transferable vote, so that the two-year terms of the two groups are staggered.

Delete “national elections”
and replace with
“the Annual Ballot, leadership by-elections, and the election of committees at conference”
So that it reads
v) All Green Party members will be eligible to vote in the Annual Ballot, leadership by-elections, and the election of committees at conference after they have been a member for a minimum of three months at the close of nominations.

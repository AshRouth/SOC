In section 1 of A01, ‘Final Agenda etc.’

To the section marked ‘Late Motions’

Add the following text:

‘SOCC permits members of SOC only to provide a mechanism by which Conference can indicate its preference for voting on a particular motion/s, and historically this has been done by simply tallying the number of co-proposers for each motion. Following discussion at a meeting of 25 September 2022, where a number of members raised concerns about whether or not this process could be refined further, it was suggested that a separate post should be added to the Late Motions Forum, which would also be consistently advertised by Workshop Facilitators, which would allow Conference attendees to simply ‘like’ motions (with no limit on the number which an individual member could ‘like’) and that as of 1 hour before the relevant Plenary this would provide SOC with a guide to which motions Conference had indicated a preference for.’

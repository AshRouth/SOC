motion_title: Ensuring Sex and Gender Are Not Conflated
amendment_number: 1
---
Delete: “Gender is a term that cannot easily be defined in
law, whereas sex has a clear meaning, and as the basis of
female oppression is essential to be recorded in many
circumstances.”

Replace with:

The words Sex and Gender are used seemingly
interchangeably in key equalities legislation and guidance.

The Green Party recognises the need for clarity, and the
value of data that relates to both physiological sex, and
gender identity. At present, it is incredibly difficult to
discern statistical differences based on physiological sex
and gender identity, resulting in erroneous analyses of
existing data being made, such as when The Times of
London published inaccurate claims that 100% of inmates
in women’s prisons, convicted of rape, were transgender
women (since retracted with a correction).

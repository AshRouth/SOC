In section 4 of A01, ‘Timetabling, chairing and other procedural matters etc.’

To the bullet point beginning ‘Looking at how to protect’,

Add at the end the following text:

‘To that end, having received concrete information suggesting that a substantial number of proxy votes had been improperly harvested and registered during Spring Conference 2022 only after the publication of the Final Agenda, the Co-Convenors of SOC decided to implement a system of photographic proof of being a nominated proxy-holder in order to more effectively safeguard Conference votes. A majority of SOC indicated its support for this measure as of 25 September 2022, but SOC nevertheless regrets that this caused some increased difficulty in using the proxy voting system, and would have supported the extension of the deadline if this were practically feasible.’

“RON shall remain a live option throughout the count, and shall not be eliminated at any stage.”
And replace with
“RON will be treated as a normal candidate within the election.”
So that it reads:
18(ii) In all elections for SOC, Policy Development Committee, Campaigns Committee, International Committee, the Dispute Resolution Committee, Equalities & Diversity Committee, the Regional Council, and the Party Executive there will be an election, even when there are no more candidates than positions to be filled. In all elections and candidate selections at national, local and regional levels within the Party provision will be made for negative voting, by the inclusion in the ballot of the option of Re-open Nominations (RON), such that if any candidate receives more negative than positive votes such candidate shall not be elected. RON will be treated as a normal candidate within the election.

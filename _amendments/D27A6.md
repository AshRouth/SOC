In Standing Orders for the Conduct of Conference (SOCC),
Amend the text in B2.4:
No more than four motions may be proposed by any constituted national Committee, recognised Working Group, Local or Regional Party (excluding motions required of them by Standing Orders or the constitution).
So that it reads:
No more than four motions may be proposed by any constituted national Committee, recognised Working Group, Local or Regional Party (excluding motions required of them by Standing Orders or the constitution) – except the Green Party Council will not be subject to any limit.

LD200 Outcomes, Add the words “and abundance” to the 4th bullet point so the whole paragraph reads:
Our policies aim to deliver the following which together define the “common good” within this context:

• improved transparency of information about the ownership of land
• increasing equality of access to land for recreation, health, education, to grow food and reduce wealth inequality
• a transition in land-use that will take place over a period of 10 years
• increased biodiversity and abundance across all land
• balancing of the natural cycles, including carbon and nitrogen, to deliver a stable biosphere
• reducing emissions from land
• increasing carbon sinks and carbon uptake
• ‘Wildlife and Habitats’ policy outcomes (WH003) and ‘Food and Agriculture’ policy aims (FA101)
• healthy food and other resources for local need
• resilient communities and sustainable livelihoods

Amend the 1st bullet point of LD401 to read:
“reversing the loss of biodiversity and abundance” so the whole paragraph reads: LD401 Changing land use is fundamental to delivering a sustainable society. Management of land should deliver multiple benefits. Policy levers (LD502) will deliver the benefits at national scale, so that the following priority order is taken into account within the broad context:

• reversing the loss of biodiversity and abundance
• reducing carbon emissions from land (e.g. peatland restoration),
• being self-sufficient in food production and biological sequestration (e.g. growing forests),
• managing land for timber and fibre
• growing biomass (wood and crops) for energy production

Change must start now. It should be completed within 10 years. It will be achieved by encouraging and supporting people to be good stewards of the land

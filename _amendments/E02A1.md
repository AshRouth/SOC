In the first paragraph at the end of the proposed insertion
add a second sentence

“We will replace these with a new Health and Care Act to
enable the delivery of care as outlined in our policies.”

So that that HE105 would then read:

“The Green Party will repeal the Health and Care Act 2022
in its entirety and the remaining provisions of the Health
and Social Care Act 2012. We will replace these with a new
Health and Care Act to enable the delivery of care as
outlined in our policies.”

In “LD602", add a reference to LP505, so that it reads,
“LD602 Planning permission shall be used as a tool to
determine when land use change may occur (i.e.
application for change of land use) and a way of levying
carbon tax against land use changes. Planning permission
shall therefore be a tool for ensuring that spatial plans (i.e.
land use change objectives) are complied with. See also
LP505, LP514 and LP517.”

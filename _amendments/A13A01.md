“the Complaints review has taken over this work”,

insert:

“We acknowledge the Disciplinary Committee for detailing their concerns with the complaints system in a statement sent at the beginning of June 2021, and for persisting with their request for an independent external review.”

So that it reads:
“GPRC have now closed the Disciplinary Complaints and Disputes working group, (DCD) as the Complaints review has taken over this work. We acknowledge the Disciplinary Committee for detailing their concerns with the complaints system in a statement sent at the beginning of June 2021, and for persisting with their request for an independent external review. We thank all of the GPRC representatives – including appeals – who have been involved in the complaints review. The complaints review will take on board the comments within the Diverse Matters report as well as an external review, to make improvements to the complaints process.”

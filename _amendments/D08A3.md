Replace the sentence in the motion which reads:

In this extended nomination period, nominations will only be accepted from candidates who fit the criteria leading to the reopening of nominations.
So that it reads:
In this extended nomination period, nominations will only be accepted from candidates who fit (at least one of) the criteria unrepresented in the first round of nominations which led to the reopening of nominations.

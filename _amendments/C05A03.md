Delete the following from motion:
Replace “economic security, otherwise people will not heed ecological restraints in their daily lives” with “secure access to the means to live a flourishing life as part of a healthy wider ecosystem” so that it reads:
“PB413 A sustainable society can be prosperous, but it cannot have continually rising affluence. We accept that there is a limit to the wealth each person can receive, and this is true no matter how much or how little work needs to be done to produce that wealth. Some redistribution of wealth will be required. What wealth there is must be shared in such a way that everyone has a guarantee of secure access to the means to live a flourishing life as part of a healthy wider ecosystem.”
And Replace with:
Replace last sentence with “What wealth there is must be shared so that everyone has secure access to the means to live a flourishing life as part of a healthy wider ecosystem.”

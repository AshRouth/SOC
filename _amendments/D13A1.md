motion_title: Change to the Constitution for Disciplinary Committee
amendment_number: 1
---

Delete the text of clause 4 (x) of the current constitution:
“There shall be a Disciplinary Committee, elected to handle
all complaints of a disciplinary nature which have not been
resolved at Regional or Local Party level. The committee
will comprise eleven members, one member from each
region, one from the Wales Green Party and a member
elected biennially at the autumn conference. The term of
office will be two years.””
And replace it with:
“There shall be a Disciplinary Committee, responsible for
handling all complaints of a disciplinary nature that have
not been or cannot be resolved at Local, Regional or Wales
Green Party level, or by another Party body formally
recognised by the Green Party Regional Council, and where
mediation has been declined or been unsuccessful.
The Disciplinary Committee will comprise twenty members,
two members from each region and two from the Wales Green Party elected in accordance with their respective
Constitutions. The term of office will be two years."

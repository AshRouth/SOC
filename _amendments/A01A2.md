Vote of No Confidence in Standing Orders Committee Member

Synopsis

At the start of the week where Conference business began, the conduct of one SOC member became such that their fellow committee-members were compelled to amend their Standing Orders so as to issue a Vote of No Confidence in them, which is now commended to Conference.

Motion: On 28 February 2022, in the week when this Conference commenced, the conduct of one SOC member in relation to: the supervision of workshops; division of work; and public communications felt to be undermining the integrity of SOC overall; caused the Convenors to call an Emergency Meeting of SOC, with all members invited.

At this meeting, which was quorate and minuted, it was proposed that the Standing Orders of SOC be amended, in line with a document which had previously been seen an approved by a majority of members, so as to allow a Vote of No Confidence in this Committee Member to take place.

This passed with a majority of members of SOC supporting the amendments to the Standing Orders. SOC therefore commends to Conference the result of its Vote of No Confidence in the relevant member.

Since the Constitution does not currently give SOC the power to remove members of the Committee from their post of its own motion, SOC therefore recommends to Conference that the relevant member be removed from his position on Standing Orders Committee as of this Conference.

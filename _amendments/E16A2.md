Delete:

Therefore when data is being collected and analysed to
form policy in relation to women, attention should be paid
to whether the data is segregated by sex or by gender, and
sex segregated data must be collected in order to monitor
the effects of biological sex with regard to womenâ€™s
position in society.

Replace with:

Therefore when data is being collected and analysed to
form policy in relation to sex or gender, attention should be
paid to exactly what data is being collected, and clear
guidance to respondents as to what data is being
requested, with clear definitions and distinctions explained.
Where practical and proportional, data related to both sex
and gender should be collected, in order to ensure that
conflations between the two (eg, the conflation of
transgender women with men) in key statistical data, and in
particular data pertaining to crime, do not take place.

Delete: “0.25” and replace with “x”
and after “without receiving a debate.”
insert:
“Where x is a number between 0.05 and 0.4 to be decided by SOC and published in their report on the order of the agenda. The value will be set with a view that this process should assist non-contentious motions which do not otherwise get support in the party to rise higher on the agenda.“
Delete: “For example a motion that has been proposed to the preceding 3 conferences shall have their points multiplied by 1.75.“
So that it reads:
f) Where a motion has been proposed to directly preceding conferences but not debated due to time restraints the points received by said motion will be multiplied by 1 plus x for every preceding conference the motion has been proposed to without receiving a debate. Where x is a number between 0.05 and 0.4 to be decided by SOC and published in their report on the order of the agenda. The value will be set with a view that this process should assist non-contentious motions which do not otherwise get support in the party to rise higher on the agenda. The wording of the motion can be slightly changed so long as the aims and intentions of the motion are not changed, and SOC shall have final say on this.

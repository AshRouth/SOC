In the Motion insert at the beginning:

Insert at the end of core principle 5, “or assuming that
interventions by us are always helpful”

So that it reads:

“Our actions should take account of the well-being of other nations, other species, and future generations. We should not pursue our well-being to the detriment of theirs or assume that interventions by us are always the helpful.”

Delete from motion (in relation to current core principle 9):
“Insert at the end “Indicators of societal and ecosystem health should be mindful of the fact that human influence has already caused rapid climate change and significantly damaged biodiveristy and ecosystem health.”

so that it reads:
“The success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should take account of factors affecting the quality of life for all people: personal freedom, social equity, health, happiness and human fulfilment. Indicators of societal and ecosystem health should be mindful of the fact that human influence has already caused rapid climate change and significantly damaged biodiversity and ecosystem health.”

And replace with:
“Replace “and human fulfilment” with “human fulfilment along with biodiversity and ecosystem health and stability” So that it reads:
“The success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should take account of factors affecting the quality of life for all people: personal freedom, social equity, health, happiness, human fulfilment along with biodiversity and ecosystem health and stability.”

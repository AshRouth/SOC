amendment_number: 1

In first sentence, after “refers to”, delete, “any bigotry directed towards LGBTIQA+ people viewed through the lens of queer theory, it does not seek to label all LGBTIQA+ people as “Queer” which some still view as a loaded term.”

and replace with:

“a fear or hatred of queer people or homosexuals. Queer is an umbrella term for people who are either not
heterosexual or not those for whom their gender identity (assuming they have one) aligns with their biological sex.”

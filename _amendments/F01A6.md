In “Changes that need to be made to align with the
proposed Land chapter.”

Insert into FR800 the words “net” and “a Green
government will work to reduce”, so that it reads,

“FR800 Supporting Green Party Industrial Policies IP202
and IP241, and climate change policy CC260, a Green
Government will work to reduce UK imports of timbers and
wood products that can be grown in the UK to net zero, and
also promote a 'Wood First' policy in all new buildings and
in retrofitting existing ones.”

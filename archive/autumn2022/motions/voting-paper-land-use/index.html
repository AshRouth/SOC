<h1>Land Use Voting Paper</h1>
<div class="my-3 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center infobox rounded text-center bg-referred" style="height: 40px">Motion referred back to conference</div>



<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Current Green Party policies require more land than exists in the UK.
In spring 2021, conference instructed the Land Use Policy Working
Group to develop policy that resolved this tension, and to seek the
opinions and involvement of Party members, policy working groups,
external organisations and the Green Parties of Scotland and Northern
Ireland.</p>

<p>This policy replaces the current Land policy. It defines key
principles and outcomes (based on and consistent with the Policy for a
Sustainable Society) and outlines the policies to achieve land use
change.</p>

<p>The ownership of land has its roots in history. What is certain is
that where no other ownership can be established, ownership currently
falls to the Crown or Duchies of Cornwall or Lancaster. We propose
that land should by default be owned by the people through one or more
Trusts (this could be one for each of the devolved administrations of
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).</p>

<p>We introduce the concept of owners of land also having
responsibilities for that land, to link land management with healthy
biodiversity and the climate crisis.</p>

<p>We have created a model of how land might be used in future. We
propose that changes in land use start now and happen within 10 years.</p>

<p>We recommend a Land Commission to provide advice and policy to
government for England and Wales, as already happens in Scotland.</p>

<p>In order to make these radical changes, we will be undertaking public
information campaigns and training up and funding young people to
manage our land differently.</p>

<h2 id="motion">Motion</h2>
<p>Delete the current Land chapter (LD100 to LD403) and replace with the
text below up until ‘END OF LAND CHAPTER’.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p><strong>LD001</strong> We live on land. We play, work, farm and build on land.
However, we share the land with plants, animals, fungi and other
species. Our policy for land-use must balance humanity’s wish to
control the earth for human benefit, with the need to share and not
destroy what we rely on. Humanity cannot completely control the earth,
and neither should it try to, as we are reliant on its full
complexity. Our society should strive for a stable environment, in
part by taking a stewardship approach to land management. This requires accepting responsibilities, such as to
future generations and to other life, when taking land management decisions. (see
PB101-105, PB201-206, PB305, MG201, RR200,201,203, 205 RR406,
RR1000-1006 and WH001-WH101).</p>

<p><strong>LD002</strong> Land is finite, the primary
source of all real wealth, and a common heritage. The way land is
managed needs to deliver good soil health, good human health, and a
resilient society, as well as maintain a stable climate and diverse
ecosystems. This currently is not happening because our economy has a
dysfunctional relationship with the land. A small number of people
control most of the land, mostly for historical reasons, but also due to
wealth inequality. This is unjust. In UK law today the Crown and Duchies
of Cornwall and Lancaster are the default owners of land if no one else
holds the land title.</p>

<h4 id="ld100-land-principles">LD100 Land principles:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The overrunning of the planet’s natural limits and the unsustainable
use of its resources should be considered as one challenge (see the Philosophical
Basis)</li>
  <li>Human activity must be managed within Earth’s natural limits</li>
  <li>Land is held in trust and managed by human society for its own needs
and the needs of other species and future generations; its use should
enhance the richness of life</li>
  <li>Land management is crucial in securing the protection, regeneration,
and restoration of nature</li>
  <li>Land management should maximise multiple benefits of land</li>
  <li>The rights and responsibilities of those who hold land will be
transparent and accountable</li>
  <li>People may have rights over the use of land but this should not
give unconditional ownership or control of it</li>
  <li>Land should be managed for the “common good” of communities and
therefore relevant communities should have a role in determining its
use</li>
  <li>Land use change should be largely implemented at the landscape
scale, at which natural systems tend to work best</li>
  <li>Benefits that come from holding land title should be distributed
according to need (mainly via taxation)</li>
  <li>Treating land as a capital investment should be discouraged, as will
be trading it for speculative profit</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ld200-outcomes">LD200 Outcomes</h4>

<p>Our policies aim to deliver the following which together define the
“common good” within this context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved transparency of information about the <strong>ownership</strong> of
land</li>
  <li>increasing <strong>equality of access</strong> to land for recreation, health,
education, to grow food and reduce wealth inequality</li>
  <li>a <strong>transition</strong> in land-use that will take place over a period of
10 years</li>
  <li>increased <strong>biodiversity</strong> across all land</li>
  <li><strong>balancing of the natural cycles,</strong> including carbon and nitrogen,
to deliver a stable biosphere</li>
  <li><strong>reducing emissions</strong> from land</li>
  <li><strong>increasing carbon sinks and carbon uptake</strong></li>
  <li>‘<strong>Wildlife and Habitats</strong>’ policy outcomes (WH003) and ‘<strong>Food and Agriculture</strong>’ policy aims (FA101)</li>
  <li><strong>healthy food</strong> and other resources for local need</li>
  <li><strong>resilient communities</strong> and <strong>sustainable livelihoods</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="ld300-land-ownership-and-stewardship">LD300 Land Ownership and Stewardship</h4>

<p><strong>LD301</strong> There will be compulsory registration of all land within a
specified time limit (see LP517). Land remaining unregistered would by
default fall to a Commons Trusts, rather than the Crown or Duchies
(See LD002, LD301). The registry will be open for public inspection
free of charge, as provided for in LP517. For transparency, any
ultimate beneficial owners of land must be recorded in the Land
Registry.</p>

<p><strong>LD302</strong> The Land Registry will define and provide the record of who
holds the land title (and therefore who stewards it), which in law
would be permanent tenure. All land in the UK may only be held by UK
Citizens (individually or collectively), or by
organisations registered at Companies House, or by components of the
UK
government. UK Residents, who are not UK Citizens, may only hold the
title of land for their own domestic dwelling and to derive a
livelihood (excluding rental), or both.</p>

<p><strong>LD303</strong> The holder of the land title will be able to use the land to
derive profits and benefits, but will also have responsibilities for
managing the land in accordance with the “common good” (PB451, MG201).
They will be referred to as “stewards”. Stewards of land will be able to transfer stewardship, in the same way
that land is bought and sold now through the property market.</p>

<p><strong>LD304</strong> Responsibilities for managing land will be reasonable and
clear. Advice and financial help will be available, but ultimately the
responsibilities will be compulsory, with legal remedy. They will
primarily affect large pieces of land rather than private gardens.</p>

<p><strong>LD305</strong> By default land will be jointly held by all citizens as
“commons” through Commons Trusts, which will be independent of
government. The Commons Trusts will ensure that land is managed for
the “common good”. They will be funded by revenues, such as Land Value
Taxation. The Commons Trusts’ policies, and major decisions will be
made in accordance with the principles of democratic participation
(see PA102 and PA103).</p>

<p><strong>LD306</strong> The Commons Trusts will be will be empowered to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide advice and guidance on the implementation of stewardship
facilitate mediation within communities</li>
  <li>facilitate voluntary reparations</li>
  <li>issue warnings</li>
  <li>as a last resort, enforce stewardship requirements by preparing a
prosecution case for referral into the legal system</li>
</ul>

<p>The maximum penalty for breach of stewardship would be removal of the
land, by compulsory purchase by the Commons Trust (as the first charge
prior to all other liabilities, including the banks and other
lenders), with the deduction of reparations and costs. Where land is
owned by limited companies, directors may be held personally
responsible.</p>

<p>In all cases sentencing would be governed by Crime and Justice chapter
which makes it clear that restorative justice is preferred and minimal
intervention required to deliver justice should be used (see
RR1002-1003, CJ200-206 &amp; 362).</p>

<h4 id="ld400-land-use-transition">LD400 Land Use Transition</h4>
<p><strong>LD401</strong> Changing land use is fundamental to delivering a sustainable
society. Management of land should deliver multiple benefits. Policy levers
(LD502) will deliver the benefits at national scale, so that the
following priority order is taken into account within the broad
context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reversing biodiversity loss</li>
  <li>reducing carbon emissions from land (e.g. peatland restoration),</li>
  <li>being self-sufficient in food production and biological
sequestration (e.g. growing forests),</li>
  <li>managing land for timber and fibre</li>
  <li>growing biomass (wood and crops) for energy production</li>
</ul>

<p>Change must start now. It should be completed within 10 years. It will
be achieved by encouraging and supporting people to be good stewards
of the land.</p>

<p>With:</p>

<p>“Change must start now and be nearing completion in 10 years time. This will be achieved by encouraging and supporting people to be good stewards of the land.</p>
</span>
</div>

<p><strong>LD402</strong> Peatlands must be restored as quickly as possible to a near
natural condition. Rewetting of lowland farmland on peat must take
precedence over upland peat, and begin immediately. Tree planting on
peatland is unviable and must stop (and all existing forestry
removed). This will be achieved primarily through land management
investment and support. (See also CC014, FA206, FA301, WH101&amp;102).</p>

<p><strong>LD403</strong> The land for the production of raw materials, such as wood,
hemp and flax, will be significantly increased, to displace
non-renewable (such as concrete, steel and plastic) and imported
natural resources (that are produced unsustainably). This will be
achieved mainly through fiscal measures (see LD502), but may need to
be backed up by additional policy to encourage behavioural change
through public education, price signals, taxation and regulation, and
technological development .</p>

<p><strong>LD404</strong> Scotland has a Land Commission and we will introduce Land
Commission(s) in the rest of the UK that will provide policy and best
practice advice on the rights and responsibility of stewardship. This
will apply at all scales of use – from gardens to estates; from
neighbourhood to catchment or bioregion.</p>

<p><strong>LD405</strong> The Land Commission(s) will review the implications of the
current distribution of land holdings, and bring forward policies
towards a more equitable distribution of stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>LD406</strong> Government will have a power to designate land for
nationally significant infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>LD407</strong> Government will also have the power to designate land
critical for certain purposes, for example National Parks; and also
may make new land use designations such as peatland, wetland,
saltmarsh and ancient woodland.</p>

<h3 id="ld500-delivering-land-use-change">LD500 Delivering land use change</h3>
<p><strong>LD501</strong> Land use strategies and plans will enable the land use
transition. These strategies and plans will guide the use of the
policy levers (LD502), to ensure delivery of the key outcomes (LD200).</p>

<p>Major changes will be needed to the current planning system, which
will include a mechanism for delivering the key outcomes of this
policy, bottom-up and top-down. Power will be held and decisions made,
democratically and at the most appropriate local level (PB302). IN402
contains a duty to cooperate at national level and this will apply.</p>

<p><strong>LD502</strong> Policy levers to deliver the proposed changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capacity building and delivering a just transition</li>
  <li>The planning system</li>
  <li>Land management investment and support</li>
  <li>Fiscal measures (taxes, tax breaks and grants)</li>
  <li>Direct government ownership and</li>
  <li>Enforcement of stewardship responsibilities by the Commons Trust</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LD503</strong> To build capacity and deliver a just transition we will need
to facilitate a mindset change to a new way of using land. We will
need education, training, and support services. It is also critical
that there is support for people whose livelihoods will need to change
(IN205, MC363). Measures will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public information campaigns</li>
  <li>Funding for land use research (see FR1400, FA301)</li>
  <li>Funding and expansion of agricultural colleges and land based
apprenticeships (see FA204)</li>
  <li>Start-up funding for young entrepreneurs in agriculture/horticulture
(see FA203) * Farm and land business advisory services (see FA202,
FA204, FA301, FA304).</li>
  <li>Support for retraining and relocating.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LD504</strong> The planning system will provide accountability and local
democratic control over land use through compliance with local and
regional plans. It will provide a mechanism for levying carbon tax
(EC777) against land use change emissions associated with
construction. In particular there will need to be land use
designations for permanent pasture, forestry, peatland and land under
agricultural rotation. See also FA301, LP412, LP505, LP514 and LP517.</p>

<p><strong>LD505</strong> Land management investment and support will be delivered by
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the
Forestry Commission. See also the Economics (EC781), Food and
Agriculture Chapter (FA304, FA203, FA202-204), Wildlife and Habitats
Chapter (WH100-106), and Forestry Chapter (FR603).</p>

<p><strong>LD506</strong> Fiscal measures <strong>-</strong> These measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Land Value Tax - see EC780, EC781, EC782, EC792 * Carbon tax - see
EC777, FA301 and CC121</li>
  <li>Tax breaks and “eco-taxes” - see EC776</li>
  <li>Grants (including for land use change)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LD507</strong> Direct government ownership (local, regional and UK)
includes public forestry estate (FR200), and social housing
(HO500-505).</p>

<p><strong>LD508</strong> Enforcement of stewardship responsibilities - As a mechanism
of last resort Commons Trust will have enforcement powers (see LD306).</p>

<p><strong>Delete paragraphs CY520-527 (Agriculture)</strong>
“CY520 Agriculture forms an important part of the rural economy,
producing food and other products, generating income and providing
employment. Agricultural land makes up a large part of the countryside
and rural landscape and supports diverse wildlife habitats. Green
Party policies on Food and Agriculture aim to improve farming
livelihoods, provide safe and nutritious food, improve long-term food
security and increase regional and local self-reliance in food. <br />
CY521 The Green Party will support shorter supply chains and direct
links between producers and consumers to maximise income generation in
rural areas and to supply healthier, fresher food. We will discourage
large-scale agribusiness, processors and retailers which take large
profit margins, concentrate jobs in urban centres and cause the closure
of small, local retailers. <br />
CY522 The Green Party will discourage the amalgamation of farms, support
family farms, improve access to land for new entrants to farming and
horticulture and favour the setting up of sustainable, small-scale and
labour-intensive enterprises and their associated dwellings. We support
sustainable diversification and multiple use of agricultural land and
buildings, for instance for appropriate renewable energy, tourism,
recreational pursuits and low-impact enterprises. <br />
CY523 The Green Party will support small-scale, environmentally benign
farming systems that protect the soil, biodiversity and water resources,
minimise greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, support ‘joined-up'
wildlife habitats and provide secure jobs in rural communities. We
support farming and land management which conserve and, where
appropriate, increase woods, orchards, agroforestry, hedges and other
trees. We will phase out ‘factory farming' and discourage farming
systems highly dependent on fossil fuels and imported feed that have
large-scale environmental impacts and tend to reduce rural income and
employment. <br />
CY524 Soil is the biggest pool of carbon stored in the land, and is an
important wildlife habitat in its own right. Soil is also an essential
resource without which human
civilisation cannot survive, yet farming is too often responsible for
depletion and degradation of the soil. Through legislation and support
for agri-environment schemes, the Green Party will ensure that all
farming and land uses protect and enhance the soil. CY525 Agriculture
accounts for a large proportion of the pollution of watercourses with
nitrates, phosphates and sediments from fertilisers, inappropriate
application and disposal of manure and from soil erosion. Release and
deposition of nitrogen
compounds pose threats to biodiversity. Pesticide spraying can threaten
watercourses and the health of farm workers, rural communities and
consumers. The Green Party will support a strategy to reduce release of
nitrogen compounds and other pollutants, will increase monitoring of
watercourses and enforce penalties for pollution of
watercourses and unsafe or inappropriate use of pesticides. <br />
CY526 The Green Party will work towards replacing the Common
Agricultural Policy, and while it still exists, support a radical
reorientation of the CAP to support
sustainable farming systems that protect and enhance wildlife habitats
and biodiversity, ensure fair and secure farm incomes, support sustainable
and thriving rural communities and promote regional and local
self-reliance in food. <br />
CY527 The Green Party welcomes the concept of agri-environment schemes
such as Environmental Stewardship and initiatives such as
catchment-sensitive farming, where agricultural support may be used for
environmentally sympathetic ends. We support
extension of the concept to the whole of the countryside. We encourage
further investment as having a positive role to play in securing the
future of the countryside.”.</p>

negative, and LVT would then become a subsidy. The effect of LVT on UK
Agriculture will be managed through changes to land management investment and support, in
line with objectives laid out in the LVT will be introduced gradually
over a number of years. As a transitional measure, where land
necessarily attached to a domestic dwelling was subject to a mortgage on
the day the tax was introduced, the tax would apply only to the value of
the land net of the mortgage. Owner occupiers aged over 65 years will
not be exempt, but they will be able to ‘roll over’ payments until the

“<strong>IN408</strong>Current land rights encourage unsustainable industrial
activity. A Land Value Tax would redress this problem. (See EC780-782,
LD305 and LD506).”.</p>

<p><strong>IN615 currently reads</strong>, “Numerous treaties designed for eco-crisis
management have failed to bring far reaching improvements. The problem
is not one of understanding but of enforcement. This role needs to be
carried out at the national level (see PL410) and aided by a new
European Environmental Agency (EEA). As well as enforcement, the EEA
should aim to provide well researched information and to establish
standards. It must be well resourced to ensure that standards can be
enforced. Funds should be diverted from the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP).</p>

<p>(TNCs - see also IP400 to IP431)”.</p>

<p><strong>Redraft</strong> the <strong>last four sentences of IN615</strong>, to reflect that we
are no longer part of the EU, <strong>so that it reads</strong>: <br />
“IN615 Numerous treaties designed for eco-crisis management have
failed to bring far reaching improvements. The problem is not one of
understanding but of enforcement. The Environment Agency must have sufficient resources to provide well

<h4 id="local-planning--the-built-environment">Local Planning &amp; the Built Environment</h4>
<p><strong>Delete LP407, “LP407</strong> The Green Party strongly supports the
provision of green belts to contain urban sprawl, to maintain the
separation of settlements, to protect prime agricultural land around
settlements, to encourage urban regeneration and compact towns and

emphasis on the green belt’s use for wider sustainable built
environment considerations such as flooding, biodiversity,
agriculture, energy production and sustainable transport.The local
authority role in reviewing and protecting their green belt is set out
in LP510.”</p>

<p><strong>Insert a new LP407</strong>, to reflect the Green Party’s land
use prioritisation: <br />
“<strong>LP407</strong> Land designated as Green Belt should be used to contain
urban sprawl, to maintain the separation of settlements, to protect
prime agricultural land around settlements, to encourage urban
regeneration and compact towns and cities, and to complement the
ecological and cultural value of other designations. Green Belt should
be used to make the sustainable built environment more resilient to
flooding, make space for biodiversity, agriculture, energy production
and sustainable transport in line with land use prioritisation set out
in LD401. The local authority role in reviewing and protecting their
green belt is set out in LP510.”.</p>

<p><strong>Amend the second sentence of LP412</strong> to reference LD504, <strong>so that LP412 reads:</strong> <br />
“LP412 Planning use classes should be used to ensure
that the built environment meets the needs of the community. The index
of classes will be set at national level and may include new use
classes such as a use class for holiday homes (see HO401) and for
categories of non built-environment land (see LD504).
Bioregional/regional strategies will include quotas for each use class
to be determined via citizens assemblies and reviewed every two years.”</p>

<p><strong>LP413 currently reads,</strong>
“All planning applications will be required to submit whole life
carbon and energy calculations. These are to include embodied carbon
and energy in both the up-front construction and anticipated
maintenance, as well as the operational carbon and energy of the
building in use. Embodied and operational carbon to be reported
separately in kgCO2e/m2 and kgCO2e/m2/yr respectively. All planning
permissions will be granted subject to a pre-commencement condition
requiring updated whole life carbon and energy calculations based on

<p><strong>Amend</strong> the <strong>first sentence of LP413 to include land use change emissions, the relevant references</strong> (LD501, 502, 504 and 505, EC777),
so that LP412 reads: <br />
“LP413 All planning applications will be required to submit whole life

“<strong>LP505</strong> Local planning authorities have a duty to implement their
Local Plans within the constraints of the existing built environment
and land they oversee, and within carbon budgets and land use
strategies set at national, regional and local levels. This provision
should meet the need identified in housing strategies (see
HO401-409).”.</p>

<p><strong>Delete from current LP506, “, for example by integrating natural</strong>
<strong>habitats into solar farms or on rooftops”,</strong> so that it reads: <br />
“LP506 As far as possible, the demand for new urban land should be
minimised through a combination of demand-reduction policies (see for
example HO401) and through optimising densities. Land value taxation
would create incentives to bring forward empty brownfield sites for
development, and local authorities would be given stronger powers to
tackle remaining land hoarding (see LP516) . Any development of
present settlements should be confined within the existing boundaries
where possible, and where a loss of countryside is deemed necessary it
should go on the least sensitive land that is most accessible by
public transport, cycling and walking to existing economic and social
facilities. The maximum environmental value should also be obtained on
land used for development.”.</p>

<p><strong>LP514 currently reads “</strong>TheGreen Party would empower local

value. We would also support the allocation of more land for
self-build.The Green Party would explore how the Land Bank and

maximise the benefits from land and property acquisition.”.</p>

<p><strong>Insert a sentence into LP514,</strong> to make it clear that the
<strong>allocation of land for selfbuild</strong> is <strong>part of the overall area of</strong>
<strong>land allocated for new build</strong> and not in addition, so that it reads: <br />
“<strong>LP514</strong> The Green Party would empower local authorities to use

<p><strong>Replace</strong> with the following,so that it reads, <br />
“LP516 To minimise land hoarding, local authorities should exercise
compulsory purchase orders in the public interest. See also LD508.”</p>

<p><strong>Amend first sentence of LP517</strong> to account for master land registry
policy being in LD301 and add cross references, <strong>so that LP517 reads:</strong> <br />
“LP517 For transparency the Land Registry will be publicly owned,
complete and open to inspection (see LD301). Local authorities would
also be required to publish open data on planning permissions with
some details of the plans. All other public authorities that collect
data on transactions and options agreements would also be required to
publish this in an open format. All public authorities considering
disposal of land assets would be required to do so transparently,
publishing its intention to do so, publishing key financial

long-term environmental sustainability of our marine environment.”.</p>

<p><strong>Insert a new</strong> “<strong>MC307</strong> As set out in LD300, the Crown Estate (which

clarify the age at which children become adults in the eyes of the law,
with accompanying full citizenship rights and responsibilities.</p>

<h4 id="tourism">Tourism</h4>
<p><strong>Amend and also update the reference in TM043 from “EC793” to “EC781”</strong>, so that it reads: <br />
“Some areas have many second homes/holiday flats, which are only
occupied for a few weeks a year. This produces very limited benefit to
the local economy. It is detrimental to the local communities, pushing
house prices higher and pricing local people out of the market. The
policy of applying a Land Value Tax shall have no reduction or exemption
for properties which are left vacant. It will deter the ownership econd
'holiday' homes and encourage greater use of underused buildings (See
781).”.</p>

own local constitutions, or Community Bills of Rights. The Green Party
recognises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to local self government</li>
  <li>the rights of nature to exist and to flourish, and</li>
  <li>the community’s right to place legal limitations on corporate legal

Our policies aim to deliver the following which together define the “common good” within this context:</p>

<p>• improved transparency of information about the ownership of land
• increasing equality of access to land for recreation, health, education, to grow food and reduce wealth inequality
• a transition in land-use that will take place over a period of 10 years
• increased biodiversity and abundance across all land
• balancing of the natural cycles, including carbon and nitrogen, to deliver a stable biosphere
• reducing emissions from land
• increasing carbon sinks and carbon uptake
• ‘Wildlife and Habitats’ policy outcomes (WH003) and ‘Food and Agriculture’ policy aims (FA101)
• healthy food and other resources for local need
• resilient communities and sustainable livelihoods</p>

<p>Amend the 1st bullet point of LD401 to read:
“reversing the loss of biodiversity and abundance” so the whole paragraph reads: LD401 Changing land use is fundamental to delivering a sustainable society. Management of land should deliver multiple benefits. Policy levers (LD502) will deliver the benefits at national scale, so that the following priority order is taken into account within the broad context:</p>

<p>• reversing the loss of biodiversity and abundance
• reducing carbon emissions from land (e.g. peatland restoration),
• being self-sufficient in food production and biological sequestration (e.g. growing forests),
• managing land for timber and fibre
• growing biomass (wood and crops) for energy production</p>

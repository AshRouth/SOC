<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p>This policy paper aims to amend the current policy that impacts on land use in the United Kingdom. It defines our key outcomes and principles, which are based on and consistent with the Philosophical Basis and existing policy and outlines policies and ways to achieve them via a range of relevant policy levers.</p>

<h2 id="motion">Motion</h2>

<p>Delete the current Land chapter (LD100 to LD403) and replace with the text below.</p>

<p>LD001 Context</p>

<p>Land is the primary source of all real wealth, and is the common heritage of people and nature. In UK law the sovereign owns all land. Over time, the right to occupy and use land, which was gained by feudal service to the sovereign, then through payment of rent to the Crown, has been replaced by payment of a one-off lump sum.  It thus appears that the free-holder has ownership of land in perpetuity, with apparent control over use or non-use, and the right to retain or sell at will.</p>

<p>LD100 Key outcomes</p>

<p>These should be the results of our policies.</p>

<p>•	In the light of the planet’s natural limits and the biological and climate emergency, humanity must immediately protect and increase biodiversity (providing us with abundant and diverse ecosystems, habitat mosaics), balance the nitrogen cycle and reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2030</p>

<p>•	Reducing wealth inequality ensuring everyone has fair access to land for recreation, health and education, and access to land to grow food, and</p>

<p>•	Providing healthy food, resilient communities, local resources, sustainable livelihoods.</p>

<p>LD200 The Land principles are:</p>

<p>•	Land is held in trust and managed by human society for its own benefit and that of other species and future generations so that activities enhance the richness of life</p>

<p>•	People may have particular rights over the use of land but not absolute ownership or control of it</p>

<p>•	These rights to particular agreed categories of use should be the responsibility of the community within a clear set of planning rules for land use</p>

<p>•	Treating land as a capital investment will be discouraged, and so will be trading it for speculative profit</p>

<p>•	Those with rights to use land will be encouraged by the use of incentives to make the best use of their land for the community, future generations and nature; this will be biased towards protection, regeneration, restoration and include penalties for pollution and degradation of land</p>

<p>•	Benefits that come from the right to use land should be shared with the community (by taxation where wealth is created)</p>

<p>•	Land rights should be transparent and accountable</p>

<p>•	The overrunning of the planet’s natural limits and the unsustainable use of its resources should be considered as one challenge</p>

<p>•	There should be a transition period that will achieve the considerable land use changes required.</p>

<p>Policies</p>

<p>LD300 Land Ownership</p>

<p>LD301 Details shall be held in a public registry of all land in the United Kingdom that will be open for public inspection free of charge, as provided for in LP517.</p>

<p>LD302 All Land, which is currently owned by the sovereign, shall be jointly owned by all citizens as ‘commons’ through Commons Trusts, which shall be independent of government. Their purpose shall be to manage land for the benefit of the ecosystem, current and future citizens (for the common good). Commons Trusts shall be funded via revenues, for example from Land Value Taxation and their policies, and major decisions will be made in accordance with the principles of democratic participations (see PA102 and PA103).</p>

<p>LD303 All land in the UK may be held as “freehold”, which in law is permanent and absolute tenure. This tenure shall encompass stewardship of the land.  All land in the UK may only be held by UK citizens (individually or collectively) or by organisations registered at Companies House.  Individual citizens (individually or collectively) who are not UK citizens may be a steward of land for their own domestic dwelling and/or to derive a livelihood.</p>

<p>LD304 Transitional provisions will move people from the current system of tenure to a system based on stewardship.</p>

<p>LD305 Stewards of land have the right to derive profits and benefits from the use of the land.  With this will come responsibility for managing the land in accordance with the defined common good (see LD302).  Stewards of land shall also hold the right to transfer stewardship, which will be identical to the way we buy and sell land currently.</p>

<p>LD306 Determining whether stewardship has failed may be initiated by the relevant community or region via a petition to the Commons Trusts.  The Commons Trusts, if they deem it appropriate, and after the issuing of warnings, shall start a judicial process to determine whether the freehold conditions have been breached and the freehold should be ended. The land shall initially become ‘common land’ managed directly by the Common’s Trusts, but in due course the Common’s Trusts may grant a new freehold.</p>

<p>LD400 Land Use Change - spatial planning</p>

<p>LD401 Land use priorities, in order of importance, are: biodiversity, reducing carbon emissions, growing food, sequestering carbon, biotic resources, energy.</p>

<p>LD402 There shall be a fundamental change of land use in the UK. The transition shall be achieved primarily by encouraging and supporting landowners to adopt land stewardship practices.  This transition shall be completed within 20 years unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>LD403 Government shall have a right to designate areas as critical national infrastructure, including current designations such as National Parks, but also new land use designations for peatland, wetland, saltmarsh and ancient woodland.</p>

<p>LD403a: To these ends, all farming and forestry on peatlands will cease and restoration to a good condition will take place over a 10 year period.    See also CC014, FA206, FA301, WH101&amp;102</p>

<p>LD404 Although much of the current planning system will be retained (see LP400-518, HO400-409), some changes will be needed (even beyond those proposed in other chapters) in order to deliver Land Policy. The National Policy Planning Framework will become obsolete as it will be replaced by Spatial Strategies (see LD405, 502 &amp; 503), and a National Economic Spatial Strategy (see IN401-404). The key change required to the planning system is expanding the scope to cover all land uses rather than focusing only on the built environment (including the UK marine environment).</p>

<p>LD405 In order for any government to make significant land use change happen, a process will need to be introduced by which targets for land use change can be set and a combination of policy levers be enacted to achieve them. Fundamental to achieve the required changes, therefore, are spatial strategies. Spatial strategy is the setting of land use change targets and land management change targets plus the oversight of processes/policies by which this change is achieved. Spatial planning is mapping to allocate certain pieces of land to certain purposes.</p>

<p>LD500 Setting a strategy</p>

<p>LD501 There shall be an overhaul of the current planning system that developed over the last 100 years. Government planning and land use strategy documents shall be reviewed to ensure that they deliver the key outcomes of this policy.</p>

<p>LD502 Power shall be held/decisions shall be made, at the lowest possible level (PB302). Spatial Strategies shall be produced at three levels:</p>

<p>•	National Level - under the Departments for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Community and Local Government</p>

<p>•	Regional Level - this may vary according to local needs, but could for example include the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, English Regions and/or Assemblies or City Administrations (see PA410-416)</p>

<p>•	Local Level - local authorities.</p>

<p>LD503 Spatial strategies shall resolve conflicts in the hierarchy of land use arising from land use key outcomes set out in LD100 from the finite land area available to us. IN402 contains a duty to cooperate at national level and this shall apply to all levels of government.</p>

<p>LD600 Policy levers to achieve land use change</p>

<p>LD601 Proposed levers are:</p>

<p>•	Planning permission,</p>

<p>•	Obligations of land stewards,</p>

<p>•	Land management subsidies,</p>

<p>•	Fiscal measures:</p>

<p>o	land value tax,</p>

<p>o	carbon tax,</p>

<p>o	tax breaks and “eco-taxes”</p>

<p>•	Direct public ownership and</p>

<p>•	Capacity building and a just transition.</p>

<p>LD602 Planning permission shall be used as a tool to determine when land use change may occur (i.e. application for change of land use) and a way of levying carbon tax against land use changes. Planning permission shall therefore be a tool for ensuring that spatial plans (i.e. land use change objectives) are complied with. See also LP514 and LP517.</p>

<p>LD603 Obligations of land stewards - see LD304-306 &amp; LD402.</p>

<p>LD604 Land management subsidies shall include stewardship grants, agricultural subsidies and payments (via a system based on the Environment Land Management (ELMs) scheme) by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Forestry England. See the Economics (EC781), Food and Agriculture Chapter (FA304, FA203), Wildlife and Habitats Chapter (TBC), and Forestry Chapter (FR603).</p>

<p>LD605 Fiscal measures - these will introduce the powers to implement the financial measures outlined in LD600 and to prescribe who will manage them. These measures include:</p>

<p>•	Land Value Tax - see EC780, EC781, EC782, EC792</p>

Advice will be provided by the government’s statutory authorities and agencies on conservation and full democratic consultation undertaken. Ecological criteria will be given full weight in all planning decisions.</p>

<p>CY541 The Green Party will ensure that planning decisions are made at the lowest appropriate level - by elected parish, town, district, county or unitary councils, and ensure that they have the necessary training and access to knowledge to make appropriate decisions. Appeals against refusals will be determined by a strengthened independent planning inspectorate, competent to take all factors into account. The Infrastructure Planning Commission, or any similar separate fast-track body for national infrastructure decisions, will be abolished as democratically unsafe. However, steps will be taken to avoid unnecessarily long hearings into major developments. The Green Party will review the case for the right to appeal against local planning approvals.</p>

<p>CY542 The Green Party will strengthen planning controls for large-scale or damaging land-use changes in the countryside, in particular, large-scale farm buildings, new and improvement works by drainage bodies and water authorities, clearances of woodland, works affecting woodland and large-scale afforestation.</p>

<p>CY543 The Green Party will introduce legislation to halt and reverse the spread of light pollution in the countryside in order to protect the dark night sky and to minimise disturbance to wildlife from artificial light. There will be a presumption against new lighting in the countryside - this will be incorporated into all Local Development Frameworks. Improved lighting design and the use of more efficient lighting will be required for new developments or replacement of existing lighting. Energy conservation, including the removal or reduction of unnecessary lighting, will be promoted.

The effect of LVT on UK Agriculture will be managed through changes to farming subsidies in line with objectives laid out in the Food &amp; Agriculture chapter. LVT will be introduced gradually over a number of years. As a transitional measure, where land necessarily attached to a domestic dwelling was subject to a mortgage on the day the tax was introduced, the tax would apply only to the value of the land net of the mortgage.

<p>Insert a new paragraph MC371, “The issuing of licences for Wind and Marine Energy will become the responsibility of the Commons Trusts (see LD300) which will have to balance competing outcomes laid out in LD100 when making such decisions and specifying conditions.”</p>

<p>From MC376, delete the phrase, “We currently know relatively little about the sea bed, except that its biology is extremely diverse and its physics can be stormy. Therefore,” and capitalise the next word, so that it read, “MC376 Installations should not be dumped or abandoned at sea. As a matter of principle, operators should expect when constructing an installation, that they will be later responsible for completely removing it.”.</p>

<p>Renumber current MC373-378, MC373-377, respectively.</p>

<p>In NR421, replace “the State” with “the Commons Trusts”, so that it reads, “NR421 All mineral rights will be held in trust by the Commons Trusts (see LD300) on behalf of the communities which occupy the land or, in the case of off-shore rights, which border it. Planning consent to exploit minerals will be subject to both local and national agreement. It will be a requirement of such consent that the environmental impact of any work is minimised and for extraction activities to maximise the resources obtained. The affected land should be returned to a similar or improved ecological status.</p>

<p>Amend and also update the reference in TM043 from “EC793” to “EC781”, so that it reads, “Some areas have many second homes/holiday flats, which are only occupied for a few weeks a year. This produces very limited benefit to the local economy. It is detrimental to the local communities, pushing house prices higher and pricing local people out of the market. The  policy of applying a Land Value Tax shall have no reduction or exemption for properties which are left vacant. It will deter the ownership of second ‘holiday’ homes and encourage greater use of underused buildings. (See EC781)”</p>

<p>Delete “TR022 These strategies would influence demand both at point of use and indirectly through promotion, information, taxation and research. In the longer term this would also include the use of land use controls. They would also act on all aspects of transport and institutional infrastructure, e.g. regulations and subsidies.”</p>

<p>And replace with, “TR022  These strategies would influence demand both at point of use and indirectly through promotion, information, taxation and research. In the longer term this would also include the use of land use controls (See LD600.).</p>

<p>Wildlife and Habitats: changes need to be reviewed as there is a new policy chapter.</p>

<p>WR203, insert, “(See LD200)”, so that it reads, “Workplace democracy will help us to attain these long-term aims. However, it must go hand in hand with other reforms that deal with discrimination, the power of the state, the ownership of land (See LD300) and the control of information. All these influence our ability to control our working lives, which in turn affects an individual’s ability to care for the planet.”.</p>

<p>No changes are proposed in this Draft Voting Paper to the Records on Policy Statements or the 2019 General Election Manifesto.</p>

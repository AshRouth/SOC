<h1>Policy Development Committee Report</h1>
<div class="my-3 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center infobox rounded text-center bg-passed" style="height: 40px">Motion passed</div>



<h3 id="committee-membership">Committee membership</h3>

<p>We welcome the four newly co-opted members to Policy
Development Committee (PDC). After a selection process
which included a very competitive field of principal
authority councillors and experienced policy campaigners,
Cllr Julian Dean, Cllr Tony Dyer, Emily Bond and Martin
Blake agreed to join the committee to support policy
development for the whole party. We thank everyone who
put themselves forward and welcome our new members to
the team.</p>

<p>PDC now is a much stronger committee, with only 3 elected
vacancies due to too few members stepping forward at
election time in summer 2021. We are hoping that the
recent appointment of an Election Returning Officer will
lead to the re-opening of nominations: keep an eye out for
how you can also join PDC.</p>

<p>The committee meets on Zoom at least every month –
minutes and notification of the meetings are posted on
Green Spaces. Members are welcome to come and
observe.</p>

<h3 id="pdc-priorities-for-2022">PDC priorities for 2022</h3>

<p>Policy Development Committee discussed, identified and
agreed three priorities for PDC for the year ahead:</p>

<p>i. Councillors – to work with elected Greens who are putting
policies into practice to support the development of
pragmatic policies and in areas where our elected Greens
can have influence
ii. Communication – to prioritise clarity and support for
Policy Working Groups and develop the support from the
Digital team to improve the policy sections of the website
(members and public facing)
iii. Strategy – to work with Political Committee and the
leadership team to identify the key areas where policy
development would be most advantageous for the party.</p>

<h3 id="accreditation">Accreditation</h3>

<p>Policy Development Committee received application forms
and background papers from the proposers of 3 motions for
accreditation for Spring Conference 2022. The criteria for
accreditation is part of the Standing Orders for the Conduct
of Conference and involves that full consultation, both
within and outwith the party has taken place, that high
quality supporting evidence has been provided, that the
motion is endorsed by a Policy Working Group or other
recognised body within the party, and that the motion is
consistent with the Party’s strategic political objectives as
advised by relevant bodies within the party.</p>

<p>The process of becoming more strategic in terms of
identifying the key areas of policies for development to
meet the needs of accreditation and the goals of the party’s
Political Strategy continues. A useful session was held at
Policy Fest to discuss how and where these needs are, with
a particular focus on Green Party Councillors, elected
Greens and our spokespeople. A Policy Strategy would help
to inform PDC when it comes to decisions regarding
accreditation.</p>

<p>PDC accredited all 3 motions, and these are now found in
Section C of the agenda. The quality of the background
papers this Conference was incredibly high with fully
referenced reports, charts and explanations. These have
already been shared with some elected Greens and we
would like to see them uploaded ! to inform members and
spokespeople and other elected Greens ! on the members’
website.</p>

<p>A reminder that accreditation is an indicator that the policy
put forward has been put together in a robust, evidence!
based manner and will meet the strategic needs of the
party. It is not a mark of validation or support by the PDC
members – approval and acceptance of the policy must be
made by Conference.</p>

<h3 id="fast-tracking">Fast-Tracking</h3>

<p>Policy Development Committee recommended to SOC
several motions for fast tracking at Autumn Conference
2021, and a number of those were successfully fast
tracked including enabling motions and some policy
motions. Fast tracking ensures that in a packed conference
agenda, particularly with all the A Reports at Autumn
Conference, important policy motions can be agreed. A
reminder that fast tracking is only appropriate for “motions
which are not contentious, do not require expenditure in
excess of £100, are consistent with already existing party
policy and will potentially not get heard due to their position
in the agenda.” Ten or more members can vote against the
fast tracking of a motion during the A reports.</p>

<h3 id="policy-website">Policy Website</h3>

<p>The policy.greenparty.org.uk website remains the essential
file of Green Party of England and Wales policy for public and party members’ perusal and reference. Currently
(January 2022) this website is not up to date from the most
recent conferences and PDC have been working with the
staff team to get to a resolution about updating the site. By
the end of 2022 the policy site should be completely
redesigned and updated, but before then the staff team will
be updating the policies from 2020 and 2021 and passed at
this conference. The committee understand the obstacles
that this has caused not just for Policy Working Groups and
members but for spokespeople and campaigners. As co!
ordinator I apologise for all these difficulties experienced. A
clear process of updating will also be put in place for the
future with those responsible for this task given the
technical abilities to do so</p>

<p>PDC are also in discussions to develop the ‘Policy’ section
of the members’ website so that it operates more like a
dashboard. This would aim to increase participation and
enable members to get more actively involved in policy
development.</p>

<h3 id="policy-fest-2022">Policy Fest 2022</h3>

<p>Huge thank you to everyone who made Policy Fest 2022
such a successful and enjoyable week. For the second
January in a row, Policy Fest moved to online only (Zoom)
and ran from Sunday to Saturday. Over 700 members
registered for the event and 40 sessions were scheduled,
covering a wide range of policy areas for development.
Members were able to attend meetings, listen to talks from
our spokespeople and external experts, view presentations
and help contribute towards writing and reviewing our
party’s policies. Engagement throughout the week was high
and response was positive. PDC could look to hosting a
further Summer Policy Fest (July?) but shorter in hours as
by then we should be enjoying the sunny weather and
pleasant evenings.</p>

<p>PDC thank all the Policy Working Groups and party
members who took part, the volunteers who gave their time
to supporting the sessions, and in particular the
Conferences team who assisted to make the entire week
run as smoothly as possible. We hope to see you at another
Policy Fest soon!</p>

<h3 id="policy-working-groups">Policy Working Groups</h3>

<p>PWGs remain the energy, expertise and driving force
behind policy development. Each Policy Chapter in Policies
for a Sustainable Society should have an active PWG and
PDC are working hard to not only ensure this is the case,
but to provide opportunities for PWGs to get together and
work across these chapter boundaries on areas which
require collaboration. A list of PWGs and their convenors
and contact details are to be found on the members’
website. Every Green Party member can join these PWGs
and would be most welcome.</p>

<h3 id="policy-process-and-review-subgroup">Policy Process and Review Subgroup</h3>

<p>This Spring Conference 2022 Agenda includes a proposal to
‘clarify and refine the Policy Process’. Whilst PDC did not
agree as a committee to support this motion in its entirety,
we agreed that there is a clear need to review the policy
process and make it more straightforward for members to
engage. PDC are looking to establish a subgroup with a
focus on reviewing and improving the policy process which
will be open to non-PDC members to take part, will report
back to GPEX and GPRC and will look to bring a motion to
conference if necessary</p>

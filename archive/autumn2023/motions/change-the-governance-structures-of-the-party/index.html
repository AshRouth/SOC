<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p>This motion changes the composition of the Regional Council and the Executive in line with the pathfinder motion submitted to Conference in Autumn 2022 and the motions submitted to Spring 2023. It increases the size of Regional Council and introduces PR; and reduces GPEx and introduces a competence threshold.</p>

<h2 id="motion">Motion</h2>

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> This motion will require a 2/3 majority to pass.</p>

<h3 id="part-one">Part One</h3>

<p>This motion calls on Conference to amend Clause 6 of the constitution as follows:</p>

<p>Delete existing clause i)</p>

<p>i)	There shall be a Green Party Regional Council which shall provide a forum for dialogue between Regions, responsible for keeping under review the general well-being of the Party and for supporting and advising the Green Party Executive, particularly on matters of political strategy.</p>

<p>and replace it with</p>

<p>i)	There shall be a Green Party Council which shall be responsible for managing the Party’s culture, creating the political strategy, and directing the political direction of the Party in between conferences.</p>

<p>ii)	It will be responsible for supporting and advising the Green Party Executive and hold the Executive to account for the delivery of the political strategy</p>

<p>And renumber, deleting Regional Council throughout Clause 6 and elsewhere in the Constitution and replacing it with Council</p>

<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">

<h3 id="amendment-1">Amendment #1</h3>
</div>
    
<p>In Part 1, in (i) replace “culture, creating the political strategy, and directing the political direction of the Party in between conferences.”</p>

<p>with: </p>

<p>“culture, wellbeing, and governance; creating the political strategy; and setting the political direction of the Party in between conferences.”</p>
  
</div>

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> an amendment originally proposing the insertion of ‘GPC’ after ‘Green Party Council’ was recognised as a minor textual amendment and made by SOC of its own motion</p>

<p>Delete existing clause iv)</p>

<p>iv)	The Regional Council shall consist of two members elected by postal ballot (as specified in Appendix C) by and from each constituted Region. Each term of membership of Regional Council shall be for two years commencing from the date of election by the individual Region. Such election shall be notified, in writing, to the Secretary of the Regional Council giving the date of election and confirmed by the Region’s Electoral Returning Officer. Such notice is to be given not less than two weeks prior to the next meeting of the Regional Council.</p>

<p>and replace it with</p>

<p>iv)	The Council shall consist of 36 members.  Each council member’s term will be for three years and 12 people will be elected every year, using a single transferable vote process, as part of the annual ballot.  Any member who has been a member for over two years will be eligible to stand.</p>

<p>v)	No person can be elected to more than two full terms consecutively. Terms will be considered non-consecutive if they are approximately one year apart. Members elected to a shortened term at the first Annual Ballot or elected to a shortened term to fill a vacancy are not considered to be elected to a full term.</p>

<p>vi)	The Green Party Leader (or Co-Leaders), the Deputy Leader (or Deputy Leaders), the Wales Leader, and the Young Greens Co-Chairs will all be voting members of the Council. Where the position is a job-share, the role will have a single vote. The two Young Greens Co-Chairs will have one vote each. The Chair and Treasurer of the Executive, plus the CEO will be non-voting members of the Council.</p>

<p>In iv)</p>

<p>insert before “36” in the first sentence: “ordinary”.</p>

<p>insert after “members” in the first sentence: in addition to the role holders outlined in section x below ; and delete “who has been a member for over two” and replace with “of the Green Party of England and Wales whose membership of the Party exceeds two continuous”.</p>

<p>So that it reads:</p>

<p>iv) The Council shall consist of 36 ordinary members in addition to the role holders outlined in section x below . Each council member’s term will be for three years and 12 people will be elected every year, using a single transferable vote process, as part of the annual ballot. Any member of the Green Party of England and Wales whose membership of the Party exceeds two continuous years will be eligible to stand.</p>

<p>Insert new sections vi – ix and renumber:</p>

<p>vi) In order to preserve the regional spread of the council, in determining the results of annual ballot to elect ordinary members of the council the following requirement will be applied. At the point of the calculating the results of the election each year, the results shall, subject to the caveats outlined in section viii, provide for there to be amongst the membership of the ordinary members of the council:</p>

<p>a. At least 1 member of Wales Green Party</p>

<p>b. At least 1 member of each English Regional Party</p>

<p>vii) If at the close of nominations set out in Section 16 Internal Elections and Annual Ballot, part 7 there are insufficient nominations submitted for election to the Council in order that the election can satisfy the requirements set out in part 4 above, then nominations will be re-opened and the requirements to satisfy the constitution published to all members. This re-opened nomination period shall close at noon 5 weekdays prior to the opening of voting.</p>

<p>viii) If following the extended nomination process detailed in section vii above, there are insufficient candidates on the ballot to satisfy the requirements set out in section vi above then the election shall proceed to elect the full number of ordinary members as required and will waive the requirements in section vi for this ballot for that particular region, or Wales, as applicable. There will be a significant communication campaign from the council over the subsequent year within the region(s) concerned, or Wales, regarding the need for candidates to put themselves forward.</p>

<p>ix) If a member of the council moves to a region of England where they had not been resident at the time of their election, or into Wales, they will continue to be a member of the council. At the next annual election, their current location of membership at time of nomination will be used to determine whether requirements under vi have been met.</p>

<p>To reflect changes made at the Wales Green Party EGM in July 2023 and ensure parity</p>

<p>In current vi), renumbered as above to x), Delete “Wales Leader” and replace with “Leader (or Co-Leaders) of the Wales Green Party, the Deputy Leader(s) of the Wales Green Party”.</p>

<p>So that it reads: x) The Green Party Leader (or Co-Leaders), the Deputy Leader (or Deputy Leaders), the Leader (or Co-Leaders) of the Wales Green Party, the Deputy Leader(s) of the Wales Green Party, and the Young Greens Co-Chairs will all be voting members of the Council.

<h3 id="part-two">Part Two</h3>

<p>This motion calls on conference to amend Clause 7 of the constitution by deleting the existing Clause 7 and replacing it with the following:</p>

<h4 id="green-party-executive">GREEN PARTY EXECUTIVE</h4>

<p>i)	There shall be a Green Party Executive (hereinafter referred to as the Party Executive or GPEx) which shall be responsible for the overall and day-to-day direction of the Party. Certain duties and responsibilities are reserved to other Party bodies specified in this Constitution, in particular Conference, Standing Orders Committee, Green Party Regional Council, Disciplinary Committee, Appeals Committee and Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee. The authority of the Executive does not extend over those reserved duties and responsibilities.</p>

<p>ii)	The Party Executive shall consist of the following voting members: Leader plus Deputy Leader(s) or Co-Leaders, Wales Green Party Leader, the two co-chairs of the Young Greens as a job share and the additional members elected to the following functional positions, to serve for two years:</p>

<p>iv)	Subject to the collective responsibility of the Executive set out in 7 i), 7 xvi) and elsewhere in section 7 or other clauses of the constitution, within one month of the election of the Ordinary Members, GPEx will set out what their areas of responsibility are such that between the Chair, Treasurer and Ordinary Members, GPEx takes accountability for all sub-committees of GPEx and their individual accountabilities are aligned to the Party’s structures and staff responsibilities. This will be done using an appropriate methodology, to ensure an acceptable workload and that each Party Executive’s skills are matches to their portfolio.</p>
